Since the lecture material is available ahead of time from the textbook and on the Web, there will be more time in lecture to discuss (in seminar style) the material rather than spending the entire 90 minutes copying the lecture notes from a blackboard. Discussions during class time are highly encouraged to fill gaps in the lecture material, to guide the pace of the class, and for you to enquire about the meaning, relevance, and importance of lecture material.</p> <h3 class=\"subsubhead\">Portfolio</h3> <p>Students are required to compile a portfolio containing notes, brainstorming ideas, concepts, sketches and final designs. This comprehensive notebook, or Personal Design Portfolio (PDP), is due toward the end of the term (See syllabus). A recommended template is provided for developing your PDP (See CD-ROM). The intent is to promote good note taking habits as an aid to understanding the material, to put your creativity down on paper and the computer, to help me assess what you are picking up in the lectures, and to grade your individual contributions to your design teams. In sum, the PDP presents a concise snapshot of what you learn throughout the entire semester and emphasizes your individual contributions.</p> <h3 class=\"subsubhead\">Problem Sets</h3> <p>All assignments are given on the syllabus homepage. Homework assignments include traditional problems, thought problems, design problems and Web-based presentations (Preliminary Design Review (PDR), and Critical Design Review (CDR).</p> <h3 class=\"subsubhead\">Lighter-than-Air (LTA) Vehicle Design Project</h3> <p>Teams of 5-6 students each would design, build, and race a remote controlled, lighter-than-air vehicle. The teams compete in their ability to carry the largest payload around a specified course in the minimum amount of time. The designs are judged on their equivalent mass/time. LTA vehicles are also judged in the categories of most reliable and most aesthetic designs. All designs are constrained to have a gross mass of less than 1.75 kg. A project kit is provided consisting of radio control equipment, batteries, balloons, electric motors, and construction materials.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Grading</h2> <p>Performance will be evaluated on the basis of class participation, reading summaries, problem sets, personal design portfolio submissions, and the LTA vehicle design project. There will be no tests or final exam. The final grade for the course will be calculated approximately as follows:</p> <ul> <li>Problem Sets and Reading Summaries 30%</li> <li>Student Personal Design Portfolio 15%</li> <li>LTA Design Project 45% (including PDR, CDR, Trials and Race)</li> <li>Attendance, Participation, General Evaluation 10%</li> </ul> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Problem Set Solutions</h2> <p>Solutions will be posted one week after problem sets are due.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Handouts</h2> <p>There will be occasional handouts in lectures. It is expected that regular attendance in lecture will offer the opportunity to pick up these handouts.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">A Note on Submission of Work</h2> <p>The manner in which you present your work can be just as important (and in some cases more so) than the final answer. Be sure to delineate each step along the way. Show a clear and logical approach to your solution. That makes your problem sets a better reference to you and easier for us to give you partial credit (if so deserving).</p> <div class=\"help slide-bottom\"> <div class=\"help-message\"> <a class=\"help-engage\" href=\"javascript: trackEvents('Bottom Get Started','bottom get started Click','Help Overlay');\">Need help getting started?</a> <a href=\"javascript:disableHelpPopup(); trackEvents('Bottom Don\\'t Show','bottom don\\'t show Click','Help Overlay');\" class=\"help-dismiss\">Don't show me this again</a> </div> </div> <div class=\"help popup-center\"> <div class=\"help-message\"> <p class=\"help-dismiss\"><a href=\"javascript:disableHelpPopup(); trackEvents('Popup Don\\'t Show','popup don\\'t show Click','Help Overlay');\">Don't show me this again</a></p> <h2>Welcome!</h2> <p>This is one of over 2,200 courses on OCW.

The standards are obvious when it comes to exams. Collaboration, such as working with others to conceptualize a problem, define approaches to the solution, or debug code, is often a gray area, and faculty in different courses may have different approaches to this issue.</p> <p>In this course, collaboration is allowed as long as it is identified. Plagiarism, such as copying someone else's solution or MATLABÂ® code, is not allowed. The write-ups must always be your own. Modifying someone else's code to make it your &quot;own&quot; is unacceptable. In case of doubt, consult the course instructor or the graduate TA.</p> <p>If you choose to collaborate with other students on the homework problems or the laboratory assignments, indicate their names and the nature of your joint work. Ensure that your collaborator does the same on his/her assignment. A useful discussion of these issues may be found at <a href=\"http://mit.edu/academicintegrity/\">MIT Academic Integrity</a>.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Assignments</h2> <ul> <li>There will be 12 problem sets and 2 laboratory assignments.</li> <li>There will be two midterm quizzes held in recitations.</li> <li>There will be written concept quizzes given in the first 20-25 minutes of each recitation.</li> <li>Concept quizzes will be replaced by small ungraded group oral exams held during three recitations, as listed in the calendar.</li> <li>Attendance is mandatory.</li> <li>There will be a comprehensive final exam during finals week.</li> </ul> <h3 class=\"subsubhead\">Problem Set Policy</h3> <p>Each problem set will typically contain a MATLAB problem. MATLAB programming is not an end in itself but a means to investigate more complex phenomena using numerical methods. The MATLAB code itself is not an adequate solution to the problem; you must interpret your numerical results and answer the questions posed. You should approach the problem with the goal to understand and explain the physical phenomena investigated and the behavior of the system for variations of the parameters.</p> <h3 class=\"subsubhead\">Submission Checklist</h3> <ol> <li>Write up the problem and submit the answers in complete form. <ol type=\"a\"> <li>For an answer to be complete, you must explain the method you used to find the solution including the equations needed and explain the setup from the code.</li> <li>You also must include the solutions that the code generated with the appropriate comments about what these solutions indicate about the question posed.</li> </ol></li> <li>If it is a MATLAB problem, submit the code that generates the answers available on the course Web site.</li> <li>Each homework problem must be on a separate sheet of paper. If you need more than one sheet you should staple them together.</li> <li>Turn paper copies in before class starts on the due date. No late work will be graded.</li> <li>Submit code through the course Web site, before class starts on the due date.</li> <li>When collaborating, be sure to write the names of those you are working with on the top of your homework. <ol type=\"a\"> <li>Collaboration is not sharing code files or copying someone's answers.</li> <li>Collaboration is asking questions to help clarify your own difficulties with the problem set.</li> </ol></li> </ol> <h3 class=\"subsubhead\">Laboratory Assignments</h3> <p>The laboratory assignments involve simulation of orbital mechanical and spacecraft mission planning. The plan for this year's laboratory assignments is to simulate missions to the moon. They require the use of MATLAB. The required analysis, derivations, results and discussion as well as the requested plots need to be turned in on paper on the due date. The code is not to be turned in on paper. Late assignments will not be accepted.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Grading</h2> <div class=\"maintabletemplate\"><table class=\"tablewidth50\" summary=\"See table caption for summary.\"> <caption class=\"invisible\">Grading criteria</caption> <thead align=\"left\"> <tr> <th scope=\"col\">ACTIVITIES</th> <th scope=\"col\">PERCENTAGES</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody align=\"left\"> <tr class=\"row\"> <td>Problem sets</td> <td>30%</td> </tr> <tr class=\"alt-row\"> <td>Concept quizzes</td> <td>20%</td> </tr> <tr class=\"row\"> <td>Laboratory assignments</td> <td>15%</td> </tr> <tr class=\"alt-row\"> <td>Midterm tests</td> <td>15%</td> </tr> <tr class=\"row\"> <td>Final exam</td> <td>20%</td> </tr> </tbody> </table></div> <p> </p> <p>The grade for one problem set and one written concept quiz will be dropped in calculating the final grade.</p> <div class=\"help slide-bottom\"> <div class=\"help-message\"> <a class=\"help-engage\" href=\"javascript: trackEvents('Bottom Get Started','bottom get started Click','Help Overlay');\">Need help getting started?</a> <a href=\"javascript:disableHelpPopup(); trackEvents('Bottom Don\\'t Show','bottom don\\'t show Click','Help Overlay');\" class=\"help-dismiss\">Don't show me this again</a> </div> </div> <div class=\"help popup-center\"> <div class=\"help-message\"> <p class=\"help-dismiss\"><a href=\"javascript:disableHelpPopup(); trackEvents('Popup Don\\'t Show','popup don\\'t show Click','Help Overlay');\">Don't show me this again</a></p> <h2>Welcome!</h2> <p>This is one of over 2,200 courses on OCW.

                    "syllabus": "<div id=\"course_inner_section\"> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Course Meeting Times</h2> <p>Lectures: 3 sessions / week, 2 hours / session</p> <p>Labs: 1 session / week, 2 hours / session</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Learning Objectives</h2> <p>16.100 is a course about aerodynamics, i.e. the study of the flow of air about a body. In our case, the body will be an airplane, but much of the aerodynamics in this course is relevant to a wide variety of applications from sail boats to automobiles to birds. 16.100 has a set of learning objectives which you should always keep in your thoughts as the semester progresses. The entire course is structured to (hopefully) help you achieve these objectives. Specifically, students graduating from 16.100 will be able to:</p> <ol> <li>Formulate and apply appropriate aerodynamic models to predict the forces on and performance of realistic three-dimensional configurations;</li> <li>Assess the applicability of aerodynamic models to predict the forces on and performance of realistic three-dimensional configurations and estimate the errors resulting from their application;</li> <li>Perform a computational and experimental aerodynamic analysis and design together with members of a team.</li> </ol> <h3 class=\"subsubhead\">Comment on Aerodynamic Models</h3> <p>An aerodynamic model is simply a method to estimate the aerodynamic performance (e.g. the lift or drag) of an object (e.g. an airfoil, wing, or airplane). An aerodynamic model could be based on experiments, computation or theory but often lies in the middle ground using a judicious combination of all three approaches. For example, an aerodynamic model might be incompressible thin airfoil theory; or, an aerodynamic model might be incompressible thin airfoil theory with a skin friction drag estimate; or, an aerodynamic model might be a wind tunnel experiment at low speed with theoretical corrections for wall effects and higher speed flight conditions. In 16.100, a variety of aerodynamic models will be covered which could then be combined to produce a more complex model as dictated by the application. Specific aerodynamic models that students will encounter may vary slightly from semester-to-semester but will generally include: 2-D/3-D potential flows (incompressible to supersonic) including panel and vortex lattice methods; boundary layer methods including the effects of transition and turbulence; coupled inviscid-viscous models; 2-D/3-D Euler and Navier-Stokes computations; wind tunnel testing.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Measurable Outcomes</h2> <p>Students graduating from 16.100 will be able to:</p> <ol> <li>Apply flow similarity, non-dimensional coefficients such as the lift and drag coefficient, and non-dimensional parameters such as the Mach number and Reynolds number in aerodynamic modeling of realistic configurations (homework, team project reports, exams).</li> <li>Apply integral momentum conservation and streamline curvature arguments to explain the relationship between flow turning, the generation of lift on an airfoil, and the subsequent loss of lift upon stall (homework, exams).</li> <li>Explain the sources of friction, induced, wave, and pressure drag (homework, exams).</li> <li>Explain the motion and deformation of a fluid element using kinematics including the definition of shear strain, normal strain, vorticity, divergence, and the substantial derivative (homework, exams).</li> <li>(a) Explain the concept of a laminar boundary layer including the definition of the displacement thickness, the momentum thickness, and the skin friction coefficient, and the importance of the Reynolds number in determining the presence and behavior of a boundary layer (homework, exams), and (b) Apply the integral boundary layer equations to describe the qualitative evolution of a laminar boundary layer including separation and to quantitatively estimate the local thickness and skin friction (homework, exams).</li> <li>Explain the onset of turbulence in a boundary layer (i.e. transition) and the qualitative effects of turbulence on boundary layer evolution including the impact on velocity profile, skin friction coefficient, boundary layer thickness, and separation (homework, exams).</li> <li>Estimate friction drag on 2-D and 3-D configurations by decomposing the geometry into patches and assuming appropriate local values of skin friction coefficients including the possibility of laminar or turbulent boundary layer conditions (homework, team project reports, exams).</li> <li>Explain the basic elements (see Comment on basic elements below) of 2-D panel methods and 3-D vortex lattice methods (homework, exams).</li> <li>Explain the basic elements of coupled inviscid-viscous models for 2-D airfoils (homework, exams).</li> <li>(a) Explain the basic elements of thin airfoil potential flow models for 2-D subsonic and supersonic flows (homework, exams), and (b) Apply thin airfoil potential flow models to estimate the forces on airfoils in 2-D subsonic and supersonic flows (homework, written exam).</li> <li>(a) Explain the basic elements of the lifting line model for high aspect ratio wings (homework, exams), (b) Describe the dependence of lift and induced drag on geometry and performance parameters (e.g. aspect ratio, twist, camber distribution, wing loading, flight speed, etc.) using the lifting line model (homework, exams), and (c) Apply the lifting line model to estimate lift, induced drag, and roll moments on high aspect ratio wings (homework, written exam).</li> <li>Explain the basic elements of the finite volume approximation to the compressible Euler and Navier-Stokes equations (homework, exams).</li> <li>(a) Explain the relationship between sound propagation and shock waves (exams), (b) Describe the qualitative change in flow conditions (Mach number, pressure, temperature, total pressure, etc.) across shocks and expansion fans (exams), (c) Estimate the change in flow conditions across shocks and expansion fans using shock-expansion theory (homework, written exam) (d) explain transonic drag rise including the critical Mach number and the use of wing sweep to delay drag rise (homework, exams).</li> <li>Explain the use of wind tunnel testing in aerodynamic modeling focusing on the importance of flow similarity in scale testing and on the typical corrections (e.g. wall corrections) required to simulate flight conditions (homework, team project reports, exams).</li> <li>Assess the ability and limitations of an aerodynamic model to estimate lift and drag (separated into friction, induced, wave, and pressure drag contributions) for a specific application (homework, team project reports, exams).</li> <li>Contribute substantially as an individual to the design and execution of a computational and experimental aerodynamic analysis of realistic 3-D configuration together with members of a team (team project reports).</li> </ol> <h3 class=\"subsubhead\">Comment on Basic Elements</h3> <p>The basic elements of a model includes the critical features which produce a valuable predictive method. For example, consider a 2-D panel method. The basic elements would include: all of the underlying assumptions of incompressible, potential flow; the discretization of an airfoil geometry into a set of line segments on which potential flow solutions are distributed; the satisfaction of flow tangency at panel control points; the global influence of an individual panel on all other panels; the imposition of the Kutta condition; etc. However, the basic elements would not include the more detailed aspects of the method which while important, are not critical to understanding how the method works. In the 2-D panel method example, it would not include the details of the calculation of the influence coefficient of a general source/vortex/doublet panel; the solution of the large linear system of equations; etc.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">General Pedagogy and Assessment Strategy</h2> <p>The skills to be gained in this course are basically of three types:</p> <ul> <li>Quantitative or Analytical Skills</li> <li>Qualitative or Conceptual Skills</li> <li>Integrative Skills</li> </ul> <p>For each skill, a different pedagogical and assessment strategy is used. Analytical skills are taught and/or assessed through the textbook reading, homework assignments, the written exams, and, to a lesser extent, the team project. Conceptual skills are taught and/or assessed through in-class conceptual questions, the oral exams, and, to a lesser extent, the project and the written exams. Integrative skills are taught and/or assessed through the project and written exams, to a lesser extent, the homework and oral exams.</p> <p>Grades will be based upon the following weightings:</p> <div class=\"maintabletemplate\"> <table class=\"tablewidth50\" summary=\"See table caption for summary.\"> <caption class=\"invisible\">Course grading.</caption> <thead align=\"left\"> <tr> <th scope=\"col\">ACTIVITIES</th> <th scope=\"col\">PERCENTAGES</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody align=\"left\"> <tr class=\"row\"> <td>Homework</td> <td>20%</td> </tr> <tr class=\"alt-row\"> <td>Exams (The Written and Oral Part of each Exam are 15% each)</td> <td>60%</td> </tr> <tr class=\"row\"> <td>Project (Assignments are 10% Total and the Design Report is 10%)</td> <td>20%</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> </div> <br /> <p>Roughly, the final letter grades will be assigned as follows:</p> <div class=\"maintabletemplate\"> <table class=\"tablewidth3\" summary=\"See table caption for summary.\"> <caption class=\"invisible\">Marks grades.</caption> <thead align=\"left\"> <tr> <th scope=\"col\">GRADES</th> <th scope=\"col\">MARKS</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody align=\"left\"> <tr class=\"row\"> <td>A</td> <td>90-100</td> </tr> <tr class=\"alt-row\"> <td>B</td> <td>80-90</td> </tr> <tr class=\"row\"> <td>C</td> <td>70-80</td> </tr> <tr class=\"alt-row\"> <td>D</td> <td>60-70</td> </tr> <tr class=\"row\"> <td>F</td> <td>0-60</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> </div> <br /> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Reading, Homework Assignments and Late Policy</h2> <p>Students are expected to complete assigned reading prior to discussion of the topics in class. The homework will be largely based on the assigned reading material with some problems based on difficult material from previous reading and lectures. The homeworks are individual efforts; while students are encouraged to discuss homework problems with each other, what is turned in must represent the student's own understanding of the material.</p> <p>Past-due homework will generally not be accepted. For unusual circumstances, exceptions could be permitted.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Team Projects and Labs</h2> <p>Students will participate in an integrative team project developed with The Boeing Company concerning the aerodynamic analysis and design of a Blended-Wing Body (BWB) aircraft. During the first two months of the semester, students will complete assignments to learn the basic skills necessary to analyze the BWB aircraft. In the final month of the semester, teams of approximately three students will complete a redesign of the BWB. These teams will be responsible for completing the design project and documenting their results in a design report.</p> <p>The weekly Labs on Wednesdays from 3-4 pm and 4-5 pm will be held in the electronic classroom. Students will be assigned to one of the sessions on the first day of class based as much as possible on preference. During the first two months of the semester, the staff will guide the students through the completion of the assignments. These assignments will be completed in pairs that the students can select, however, the pairs must be different for each of the assignments. Then, in the final month, the Labs will be dedicated to the teams working on the design project with staff in attendance to provide guidance. The students will be assigned to the design teams by the staff. <strong>Attendance will be taken for all lab sessions</strong>.</p> <p>The total individual student grade on the design project will be based on a team project grade (20%) and an individual contribution grade (80%). The individual contribution will be assessed from three sources:</p> <ol> <li>Instructor interactions with the teams throughout the semester including work session attendance,</li> <li>Written (emailed) evaluations after each milestone by all team members of the contributions of each team member (including self-evaluations), and</li> <li>Delineation within the written reports of an individual's contributions.</li> </ol> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Exams</h2> <p>The exams will have a take-home written portion and an oral portion. Students will have a few days to complete the written exam (see the <a href=\"/courses/aeronautics-and-astronautics/16-100-aerodynamics-fall-2005/calendar\">calendar</a> section for the specific sessions, the take-home exams will be distributed and due). The written exams will then be followed by an oral exam. The oral exams will be largely, though not exclusively, based on the questions from the written exam. The oral exam will be 30 minutes in length, conducted by Prof. Darmofal. The written exam questions will be similar to homework questions focusing mainly on quantitative and integrative abilities. The oral exams will focus on conceptual understanding.</p> <div class=\"help slide-bottom\"> <div class=\"help-message\"> <a class=\"help-engage\" href=\"javascript: trackEvents('Bottom Get Started','bottom get started Click','Help Overlay');\">Need help getting started?</a> <a href=\"javascript:disableHelpPopup(); trackEvents('Bottom Don\\'t Show','bottom don\\'t show Click','Help Overlay');\" class=\"help-dismiss\">Don't show me this again</a> </div> </div> <div class=\"help popup-center\"> <div class=\"help-message\"> <p class=\"help-dismiss\"><a href=\"javascript:disableHelpPopup(); trackEvents('Popup Don\\'t Show','popup don\\'t show Click','Help Overlay');\">Don't show me this again</a></p> <h2>Welcome!</h2> <p>This is one of over 2,200 courses on OCW.

The emphasis tends to be on problems that arise in air breathing propulsion, but the application of the concepts covered is more general, and the course is wider in scope, than turbomachines (in spite of the title). Stated more directly, the focus is on the fluid mechanic principles that determine the behavior of a broad class of industrial devices. The material can therefore be characterized, only partly tongue in cheek, as &quot;industrial strength fluid mechanics done in a rigorous manner&quot;.</p> <p>Internal flow exhibits a rich array of phenomena. Further, the topics we will cover are generally not dealt with in subjects or texts about external fluid dynamics; the flows described in 16.540 are generally rotational, often three-dimensional, sometimes unsteady, and sometimes occurring in non-inertial (e.g., rotating) coordinate systems. The aim is to give you an appreciation for, and an ability to quantify, these phenomena.</p> <p>Much of the content and style of the course can be viewed as the development of flow models and ideas to allow physical insight into the behavior of three-dimensional and unsteady flows. In this sense, the course can be considered to highlight the use of simplified (but conceptually sophisticated) flow modeling as a complement to subjects which address the development of computational techniques. From this perspective, a goal of the course is to provide an increased ability to interpret computational results and hence to effectively extract conclusions about the key features of complex internal flows.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Lectures</h2> <p>The lecturers for the course are:</p> <p>Prof. Edward M. Greitzer<br /> Dr. Choon S. Tan</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Text</h2> <p>The text for the class is:</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0521343933/ref=nosim/mitopencourse-20\"><img align=\"absMiddle\" border=\"0\" src=\"/images/a_logo_17.gif\" alt=\"Buy at Amazon\" /></a> Greitzer, E., C. Tan, and M. Graf. <em>Internal Flow: Concepts and Applications</em>. Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press, 2004. ISBN: 9780521343930.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Course Grading and Assignments</h2> <p>Given that a text exists for the course material, it is the intent of the lectures to discuss the material rather than to present it for the first time in class. As such you will be expected to read the material before class and to engage in in-class discussions of the reading material (these may include answering questions, elaborating concepts, etc.). Student class participation will count for 10% of the final course grade.</p> <p>You will be asked to develop &quot;concept questions&quot; which help to illustrate the physical principles and approximations that are made. This will be done in small (three or four person) teams so you can discuss the questions among yourselves. One of these questions is to be developed each week by each team. They are to be handed in by 6 pm on the Friday before the lectures take place. The concept questions will count for 10% of the final grade.</p> <p>Approximately eight short (~20 minute) &quot;concept quizzes&quot; will be given during class, roughly equally spaced throughout the term. These may make use of the questions generated by students. The total of these quizzes will count for 20% of the final course grade.</p> <p>A team project on internal flow modeling will be assigned. The project will be on a topic you choose from a list of topics supplied by the instructors. The team project will count for 20% of the grade each.</p> <p>An oral mid-term exam and an oral final exam will be held. The mid-term and final exams will count for 15% and 25% of the final course grade respectively.</p> <p>The instructors reserve the right to alter the percentages slightly, depending on circumstances.</p> <p> </p><div class=\"maintabletemplate\"><table summary=\"See table caption for summary.\" class=\"tablewidth3\"> <caption class=\"invisible\">Grading criteria.</caption> <thead align=\"left\"> <tr> <th scope=\"col\">ACTIVITIES</th> <th scope=\"col\">PERCENTAGES</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody align=\"left\"> <tr class=\"row\"> <td>Class participation</td> <td>10%</td> </tr> <tr class=\"alt-row\"> <td>Concept questions</td> <td>10%</td> </tr> <tr class=\"row\"> <td>Concept quizzes</td> <td>20%</td> </tr> <tr clas=\"alt-row\"> <td>Team project</td> <td>20%</td> </tr> <tr class=\"row\"> <td>Mid-term exam</td> <td>15%</td> </tr> <tr clas=\"alt-row\"> <td>Final exams</td> <td>25%</td> </tr> </tbody> </table></div> <p> </p><h2 class=\"subhead\">Learning Objectives for 16.540</h2> <ol> <li>Development of &quot;physical insight&quot; into the phenomena which characterize internal flow in fluid machinery (not just <strong>what</strong> happened, but <strong>why</strong> it happened).</li> <li>Ability to define, in a rigorous manner, the levels of modeling needed for useful descriptions of a number of internal flow situations.</li> <li>Ability to interpret numerical simulations and experimental results in terms of concepts and principles such as those enumerated below.</li> </ol> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Measurable Outcomes for 16.540</h2> <p>Measurable outcomes are just what the name implies, in other words those items that follow directly from the learning objectives and that we can explicitly measure.

Lectures follow the &quot;V&quot;-model of Systems Engineering, including needs identification, requirements formulation, concept generation and selection, trade studies, preliminary and detailed design, component and subsystem test and integration as well as functional testing and delivery and operations. Additional concepts such as tradeoffs between performance, cost and system operability will be discussed. Systems Engineering standards and selected journal articles serve as a basis for readings, and individual homework assignments will apply the concepts from class. Both aeronautical and astronautical applications are covered. The class serves as preparation for the systems field exam in the Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics.</p> <p>Students wishing to only participate in the journal club should register under <em>16.980 Advanced Special Project</em> for 3 units.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Prerequisites</h2> <p>The prerequisite for the course is permission of the instructor.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Motivation</h2> <p>Complex aerospace systems like aircraft, satellites and launch vehicles consist of thousands of different parts that all work together to achieve a number of value-added functions. Examples of such functions are transporting people and goods from one place to another or gathering and disseminating information from remote locations. The parts can be hardware, software or &quot;humanware&quot;. Humans are indeed an integral part of these systems as designers, operators, passengers and maintainers. We use the term &quot;stakeholders&quot; to identify people and organizations that have a stake in the system. Systems Engineering is a discipline whose aim it is to coordinate all design and management activities during aerospace projects in a way that the outcome meets requirements and that these requirements satisfy stakeholder needs. In other words systems engineering is about designing and managing the parts, their interfaces and their collective behavior in a way that produces the intended outcome.</p> <p>Best practices and formal methods of systems engineering have emerged since the 1950's and have been codified in a number of standards and handbooks.<sup>i</sup> These standards are very helpful in giving structure and consistency to the systems engineering process. In this class we will learn about the most important standards and the major steps and methods that support the design and management of aerospace systems. Given the fact that this is a 6-unit class, this introduction will be cursory and provide a general overview, rather than an in-depth treatment. Skillful and experienced systems engineers acquire their craft over the course of many years by participating and leading numerous projects. Thus, this class is merely a &quot;door opener&quot; to the world of systems engineering.</p> <p>Unfortunately, the current state of knowledge and recommended practices in systems engineering are far from perfect. If they were we would not witness cost and schedule overruns in many aerospace projects (such as the recent Boeing 787 Dreamliner project) and major accidents such as airline crashes<sup>ii</sup> and launch vehicle failures would not exist. Indeed, as aerospace systems performance has increased dramatically they have also been getting more complex, and so has the challenge of designing and managing them. In other words Systems Engineering is evolving and we are still grappling with significant challenges such as making these systems more affordable and user friendly, while ensuring system safety in all operating modes. Due to various uncertainties it has become desirable to design systems in a way that they are easy to maintain and evolve over their entire lifecycle. We will explore these frontier topics in systems engineering through reading and discussion of a variety of journal and conference papers.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Learning Objectives</h2> <p>The students in this class will be able to:</p> <ul> <li>Enumerate and describe the most important Systems Engineering standards and best practices<sup>iii</sup></li> <li>Summarize the key steps in the systems engineering process starting with stakeholder analysis and ending with transitioning systems to operations</li> <li>Appreciate the important role of humans as beneficiaries, designers, operators and maintainers of aerospace systems</li> <li>Articulate the limitations of the way that current systems engineering is practiced in terms of dealing with complexity, lifecycle uncertainty and other factors</li> <li>Apply some of the fundamental methods and tools of systems engineering to some basic &quot;toy&quot; examples as a stepping stone to more complex and real world projects</li> </ul> <p>Additionally, the class will provide preparation for the field exam in the area of systems for those students wishing to qualify for the doctoral program in the Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Class Format and Structure</h2> <p>The class consists of four pedagogical elements that are interwoven to maximize the use of both individual and class time. These elements are lectures, assignments, readings and a (voluntary) design competition.</p> <p><strong>Lectures:</strong> The lectures will last 60 minutes and will present some of the key ideas and concepts for particular steps of the systems engineering process. The lectures will roughly follow the &quot;V&quot; model of systems engineering (see figure below).</p> <p><br /> <img width=\"500\" height=\"327\" src=\"/courses/aeronautics-and-astronautics/16-842-fundamentals-of-systems-engineering-fall-2009/syllabus/syllabus_16.842_p02.jpg\" alt=\"Diagram of the course units and how they relate to one another.\" /></p> <p class=\"instruction\">The structure of the 16.842 class follows the &quot;V&quot; model. (Image by MIT OpenCourseWare.)</p> <p><strong>Assignments:</strong> The assignments will be based in part on past oral and written exam questions in the doctoral qualifying exams since 1999. These questions will be partly quantitative and partly qualitative and should require on the order of 2 hours to solve. The assignments will reinforce lecture concepts and include solving systems questions in the area of vehicle design and performance. They will be scheduled such that they are more or less synchronized with the class materials.</p> <p><strong>Readings:</strong> The readings in this class or are of two types. First we will assign weekly readings from the NASA Systems Engineering Handbook<sup>iv</sup> to supplement the class materials. You can expect to read about 40 pages per week in this fashion. Second we will have one or two journal or conference papers per week as assigned reading (journal club). A team of students will prepare a short presentation of each weekly paper (about 20 minutes) and will lead a peer discussion about its contents, merits and potential demerits.</p> <p><strong>Design Competition:</strong> Towards the end of the semester we will announce the rules of a friendly design competition using a robotics context. This will be most likely use the LEGOÂ® Mindstorms (NXT 2.0) kit and ask students to design and build a machine that will participate in a tournament style competition at the end of the semester after the end of scheduled classes. The outcome of the design competition will not contribute to the class grade and participation is voluntary.</p> <p>There will be two online quizzes in the class, one at the mid-point of the semester and the other one at the end. These quizzes are open book.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Grading</h2> <p>For those enrolled in the 6-unit course 16.842, the grading will occur on the letter scale A-F following standard MIT grading policy. The grade will be composed as follows:</p> <div class=\"maintabletemplate\"><table summary=\"See table caption for summary.\" class=\"tablewidth50\"> <caption class=\"invisible\">Grading criteria.</caption> <thead align=\"left\"> <tr> <th scope=\"col\">ACTIVITIES</th> <th scope=\"col\">PERCENTAGES</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody align=\"left\"> <tr class=\"row\"> <td>Assignments</td> <td>60%</td> </tr> <tr class=\"alt-row\"> <td>Mid-term and end-of-term quizzes</td> <td>30%</td> </tr> <tr class=\"row\"> <td>Active class participation</td> <td>10%</td> </tr> </tbody> </table></div> <p>The best 3 scores out of 4 total homework assignments will be used for the Assignments grade. Thus, students may still achieve a grade of A even if they miss one assignment.</p> <p>Students registering only for the <em>16.980 Advanced Individual Study</em> (journal club) will be graded strictly on pass/fail. To obtain a passing grade, students must present one paper and participate in at least 70% of the discussion sessions.</p> <p><br /> </p> <p class=\"instruction\"><sup>i</sup> NASA. <em>NASA Systems Engineering Handbook</em>.

We will learn about subsystem functions and performance measures. We will discuss and practice evaluating tradeoffs of performance among alternative designs that may satisfy the required subsystem function and optimize higher-level system performance or cost requirements. We will also examine the environments and interfaces that impact satellite design, including launch systems and the space environment. We will discuss payloads in a general sense, with specific examples to highlight the payload's influence on the design of other subsystems.</p> <p>At the end of this course the student will have a fundamental understanding of the factors influencing subsystem design and will be able to evaluate the impact of tradeoffs between subsystem requirements on the performance and cost at the system level.</p> <p>We will not design a satellite in this subject. Our focus is on an understanding of subsystems and their relationships. Instead we build a foundation upon which later subjects (e.g. 16.89 Space System Engineering) design satellite systems. In those subjects you will use the skills and tools developed in this class to evaluate alternative designs at the system level.</p> <p>We will, however, use a satellite system (or several systems) to provide a context for the subsystem discussions. These examples are useful because they provide realistic examples and highlight the challenges that drive tradeoffs in performance.</p> <p>Some of the students in this course may already have some knowledge of specific spacecraft subsystems. While the overall format of the class is lecture, it is hoped that all will contribute to our discussions from their work and study experience.</p> <p>Once again, the purpose of the course is for you to learn about satellite subsystems. If there is something you do not understand, ask about it. Discussions allow us to explore the subject and significantly improve our understanding.</p> <h3 class=\"subsubhead\"><a id=\"1_1\" name=\"1_1\"></a>1.1 Course Learning Objectives</h3> <p>By the end of the course the student will have demonstrated the ability to:</p> <ol> <li>Understand the function of spacecraft subsystems.</li> <li>Apply orbital mechanics formula and tools to spacecraft mission design.</li> <li>Select appropriate launch systems and understand their affect on satellite and payload design and performance.</li> <li>Evaluate spacecraft subsystem performance and trades</li> <li>Estimate space system costs</li> <li>Trade subsystem performance requirements to optimize higher-level system performance, cost, or weight.</li> </ol> <h2 class=\"subhead\"><a id=\"2_0\" name=\"2_0\"></a>2.0 Organization</h2> <p>Satellite Engineering is a twelve (12) unit course consisting of three (3) hours of lecture, and nine (9) hours of homework per week. It is an H-level Graduate credit course. Classes are held on Mondays and Wednesdays from 1 pm to 2:30 pm.</p> <p>Primary faculty for the course will be John E Keesee and Professor David W Miller. Additional Aeronautics/Astronautics department faculty may deliver some of the lectures since they are experts in particular subsystems and environments.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\"><a id=\"3_0\" name=\"3_0\"></a>3.0 Homework</h2> <h3 class=\"subsubhead\"><a id=\"3_1\" name=\"3_1\"></a>3.1 Problem Sets</h3> <p>Homework for this class will be worked in teams who will be selected by the instructors and changed during the semester. Homework will be handed out every other Wednesday and will be due one week later. In some cases each team's homework problems may be unique. When homework is turned in you should make two copies of your work, one for the instructor and one for another team to evaluate. In the next week you will prepare an evaluation of the other team's work.</p> <h3 class=\"subsubhead\"><a id=\"3_2\" name=\"3_2\"></a>3.2 Module Development</h3> <p>Most of the homework problems will require the coding of software modules. We suggest you use MATLAB to code these modules and will provide a tutorial to help you learn the programming language. We intend for these modules to be useful in future subjects (e.g. 16.89) or satellite system design work beyond your studies at MIT. The point of analyzing the other teams' work and receiving comments on your own is to help you build useful and effective tools. Your modules will very likely be used in 16.89 Space Systems Engineering.</p> <p>The modules should mathematically capture the relationships between the discipline's inputs and outputs and in general relate subsystem performance and cost to the subsystem's requirements. When used in an integrated concurrent engineering context, you will be asked to determine how the subsystem performance or cost will change as a result of changes in the requirements. The module must be complex enough to capture the important relationships yet simple enough to provide outputs that make sense. You should ensure that your modules are appropriately documented with explicit definitions of input and output so that you and others will understand its structure in the 16.851 evaluation as well as future applications. You are likely to use this program again in the future or may need to use part of it in developing the solution to another problem. You might have to update it or correct errors. In any case, the faculty and the review team will grade it. Documentation is essential so that we can understand and give proper credit for your work. Good documentation would include:</p> <ol> <li>Programmer's name</li> <li>A concise requirements specification</li> <li>Descriptions of problem inputs, expected outputs, constraints and applicable formula</li> <li>A pseudo-code or flowchart for its algorithm (optional)</li> <li>A source program listing</li> <li>A hardcopy of a sample test run of the program</li> <li>A user's guide explaining to nonprogrammer users how the program should be used (optional)</li> </ol> <h2 class=\"subhead\"><a id=\"4_0\" name=\"4_0\"></a>4.0 Portfolio</h2> <p>One of the key products of this class is a personal portfolio. The portfolio provides both a personal reflection on the learning experience as well as a central collection of the tools and reference material from the course. The portfolio should contain:</p> <ol> <li>Your learning objectives for the class.</li> <li>Your reflections on the learning experiences with respect to the learning objectives.</li> <li>All of the tools you developed, including particularly the software modules and the problem sets and their solutions you or others developed.</li> <li>Web sites and reference material you found useful.</li> <li>Whatever else would be useful for your review of the subject.</li> </ol> <p>The portfolio format is up to you to choose but it should be well organized. It may be captured on paper or electronically in a computer file or on a web site. You will turn in the portfolio (or provide a url) for grading three times during the semester.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\"><a id=\"5_0\" name=\"5_0\"></a>5.0 Communications</h2> <h3 class=\"subsubhead\"><a id=\"5_1\" name=\"5_1\"></a>5.1 Staff Meetings</h3> <p>The faculty and staff will meet every Monday at 10am to discuss the progress of the class.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\"><a id=\"6_0\" name=\"6_0\"></a>6.0 Grading</h2> <p>Grading for 16.851 is based upon the criteria shown in the following table.

Additional materials, updated as needed by Professor de Neufville, can be found there.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Important Notes</h2> <ul> <li>This course emphasizes the development of &quot;application portfolios&quot;. These assignments show how the course material applies to each student's own professional interests (see the <a href=\"/courses/engineering-systems-division/esd-71-engineering-systems-analysis-for-design-fall-2008/assignments\">assignments</a> section). Students have routinely incorporated these applications in their research, thesis, and professional presentations.</li> <li>The subject assumes that participants are competent in the material covered by ESD.70J, the 3-unit micro-subject that covers Excel spreadsheet analyses. Go to that site for a self-assessment of whether you need to audit that subject (experience indicates you probably do).</li> </ul> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Organization of Subject</h2> <p>This subject focuses on the flexible design of engineering systems. It recognizes that the future is necessarily uncertain, and that we need to deliver good value for the range of possible scenarios. Flexible designs enable system operators to adapt their project to future circumstances, to avoid downside risks and to take advantage of upside opportunities.</p> <p>Many researchers and practitioners believe that flexible design will revolutionize the way we develop and manage complex projects. Indeed, case studies indicate that the approach can improve expected performance by around 25 percent. These are significant opportunities.</p> <p>The course shows how design flexibility can substantially increase the expected value of a system. It presents an integrated approach that</p> <ul> <li>properly deals with evaluation over time in risky situations, and</li> <li>pinpoints the value of specific design elements.</li> </ul> <p>The course consists of 3 major blocks.</p> <h3 class=\"subsubhead\">Basics: Recognition of Uncertainty, Valuation Fundamentals, and Timing Issues</h3> <p>This introductory block establishes three fundamental issues and provides the economic motivation for flexibility in design:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Recognition of Uncertainty</strong> is the crucial starting point. The understanding that the future is uncertain and that we must design our systems to operate in many possible scenarios provides the motivation for making our systems adaptable, for building flexibility into them.</li> <li><strong>Valuation Fundamentals</strong> covers the main analytic and conceptual issues associated with the valuation long-term projects. Here, the primary concern is with the relative value of the projects over time.</li> <li><strong>Timing Issues</strong> discusses the design issues â principally economies of scale and learning curves â that affect the tradeoff between building larger projects initially versus developing systems incrementally over time.</li> </ul> <h3 class=\"subsubhead\">Uncertainty Modeling and Flexibility Valuation Methods</h3> <p>This is the core analytic section of the course. It presents Decision Analysis and Lattice Analysis as the two means to assess the value of flexibility in design. Both provide ways to think through the many ways in which scenarios will occur over time, and correspondingly how system developers can react effectively to these alternate futures. Decision Analysis makes is possible to look at more complex futures, while Lattice Analysis is computationally much more efficient. Analysts need to understand the relative merits of each approach and which to use when, either singly or in combination.</p> <p>This section builds upon the Monte Carlo simulation methods presented in the Excel mini-course (ESD.70J) given at the start of the semester.</p> <h3 class=\"subsubhead\">Flexibility Identification Methods &quot;in&quot; Systems</h3> <p>This section explores the question of how designers can identify the parts of the system that should be flexible. The issue is that any significant system could be flexible in many, many different ways and it is important to identify which elements might most effectively contribute to increasing the expected value of the overall system. This is a primary area of current research, and the course will showcase current and recent doctoral research and other projects at the forefront of the field.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Prerequisites</h2> <p>This subject builds upon a basic knowledge of calculus and probability.</p> <p>Students should be proficient in the use of spreadsheet programs at the level covered by ESD.70J, the 3-unit intensive short course designed to bring them up to speed in Excel. In general, everyone will benefit from participating in this offering.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Course Materials</h2> <p>The primary text for the class consists of draft chapters from the new text being written for the MIT Press. Prof. de Neufville will distribute these electronically throughout the semester.</p> <p>This material is supplemented by chapters from:</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0070163723/ref=nosim/mitopencourse-20\"><img align=\"absMiddle\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Buy at Amazon\" src=\"/images/a_logo_17.gif\" /></a> de Neufville, Richard. <em>Applied Systems Analysis</em>. New York, NY: McGraw-Hill, 1990. ISBN: 9780070163720.</p> <p>Extensive references and papers are available from the <a href=\"http://ardent.mit.edu/real_options/ROcse_MIT_latest/index.html\">course Web site</a>.</p> <p>All students will be expected to have an up-to-date full version of Excel. They may also want to try the following optional add-ins:</p> <p><strong>TreeAge Pro</strong> can be downloaded for a 21-day trial from: <a href=\"http://treeage-pro.software.informer.com/6.0/\">TreeAge Pro Trial Version Download</a>, and student licenses can be obtained from: <a href=\"https://www.treeage.com/shop/\">The TreeAge Software Store</a>.</p> <p><strong>Crystal Ball</strong> information is available here: <a href=\"http://www.oracle.com/industries/education/oracle-crystal-ball-classroom-edition.html\">Oracle Crystal Ball Classroom Edition</a>.</p> <p>Participants can view and download PDF copies of the PowerPoint slides on the course Web site. As the instructors routinely improve their presentations as the class proceeds, the Web versions of the slides change from time to time. Students may wish to verify that they have the latest version before downloading the slides for reference in class.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Recitations</h2> <p>There will be regular weekly problem-solving sessions. Prof. de Neufville will schedule these in consultation with the class during the opening session.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Assignments</h2> <p>The graded assignments for the class mainly involve the &quot;application portfolio&quot;. This is a collection of applications, on topics individually selected by each student, using the methods presented in class on an issue. This has two phases:</p> <ul> <li>Individual assignments throughout the semester.</li> <li>A final portfolio that builds upon the individual assignments and the feedback during the semester. It will present an integrated whole so that each student will each have a completed case study demonstrating how they can use design flexibility to increase the expected value of their systems.</li> </ul> <p>Ungraded problems drawn from the <em>Applied Systems Analysis</em> text are distributed throughout the semester. Students are advised to complete them as a way of insuring that they know how to complete the applications â and pass the tests! Solutions to these problems will be posted so that students can grade themselves and get immediate feedback.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Grading</h2> <p>Grades depend principally on the application portfolio and tests, but include an allowance for class participation. The approximate weights are:</p> <div class=\"maintabletemplate\"><table class=\"tablewidth50\" summary=\"See table caption for summary.\"> <caption class=\"invisible\">Grading criteria.</caption> <thead align=\"left\"> <tr> <th scope=\"col\">ACTIVITIES</th> <th scope=\"col\">PERCENTAGES</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody align=\"left\"> <tr class=\"row\"> <td>Individual and final application portfolio</td> <td>40%</td> </tr> <tr class=\"alt-row\"> <td>Class participation and graded assignments</td> <td>15%</td> </tr> <tr class=\"row\"> <td>Mid-semester quiz</td> <td>20%</td> </tr> <tr class=\"alt-row\"> <td>Final examination</td> <td>25%</td> </tr> </tbody> </table></div> <p> </p> <p>Students should complete assignments on time. The teaching assistant will mark down unexcused late assignments.</p> <p>The instructors will modulate the final grade in appreciation of the participant's progress throughout the semester. Those who finish strongly and demonstrate that they have, at the end, mastered the material will receive more credit for the final grades.</p> <p>Previous quizzes and exams are posted in the &quot;Exercises&quot; section of the Web page. They indicate the kind of questions likely to appear on future exams. However, their content may not match the current syllabus, which is evolving along with research advances.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Academic Honesty</h2> <p>To avoid confusion that might result from different expectations in other contexts or establishments, please note the standards that apply in this subject:</p> <ul> <li>Assignments turned in for grading must be done individually. The instructors understand that students will discuss the course and often learn best collectively. However, students should prepare their reports for each assignment individually, in their own format and words.</li> <li>Demonstrated evidence of copying (exactly the same presentation, same wording of sentences, etc.) will result in zeros for each paper with this evidence.</li> <li>Anyone found cheating in an examination (copying from another student or using unauthorized materials, etc.) will receive a zero for the event.</li> <li>Material copied from other sources (articles, reports, Web pages, etc) must be properly cited. Evidence that material has been taken from elsewhere without citation will be treated as plagiarism.</li> <li>Prof. de Neufville will place a note in the student record of each person associated with plagiarism or cheating. MIT views these infractions seriously and routinely expels students who seriously violate our academic standards.</li> </ul> <p>Any questions about this policy should be addressed to the instructors.</p> <div class=\"help slide-bottom\"> <div class=\"help-message\"> <a class=\"help-engage\" href=\"javascript: trackEvents('Bottom Get Started','bottom get started Click','Help Overlay');\">Need help getting started?</a> <a href=\"javascript:disableHelpPopup(); trackEvents('Bottom Don\\'t Show','bottom don\\'t show Click','Help Overlay');\" class=\"help-dismiss\">Don't show me this again</a> </div> </div> <div class=\"help popup-center\"> <div class=\"help-message\"> <p class=\"help-dismiss\"><a href=\"javascript:disableHelpPopup(); trackEvents('Popup Don\\'t Show','popup don\\'t show Click','Help Overlay');\">Don't show me this again</a></p> <h2>Welcome!</h2> <p>This is one of over 2,200 courses on OCW.

You then look to see whether that formal order gives you a hint about, say, where to put the structure of your building, what materials to use in building it, and where to place openings. If your formal order suggests nothing (or says really stupid things) then you backtrack and seek another one. But if your formal order talks to you and things seem to fall into place almost of their own accord â if they &quot;concatenate,&quot; as we say in 4.101 â then design will have happened, right before your eyes, by the actions of your own mind and hands.</p> <p>To ensure that this experience happens for you, we give you a vocabulary of the kinds of places you'll work with, we focus on two specific ways of organizing space, and we work with just two materials â concrete and wood frame construction. Not that this limits your creativity: we want to lower the number of possibilities you have to deal with from &quot;infinite&quot; to &quot;more than you can possibly imagine!&quot;</p> <p>You'll do two design projects: a preliminary one to learn design skills, and a final one to test and demonstrate those skills. There is no prerequisite for 4.101: we'll teach you all you need to know.</p> <p><strong>Note</strong>: Required for Architecture majors.</p> </div>",

The course focuses on teaching architectural design with CAD drawing, 3-D modeling, rendering and rapid prototyping. Students will be required to build computer models that will lead to a full package of architectural explorations with computers. Each semester we will explore the design process of a particular building type and building material.</p> <p>The course also investigates a few design processes of selected architects. The course is critical of design principles and building production methods. Student assignments are graded based on the quality of design, representation and constructability. Great design input is always encouraged.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Course Format</h2> <p>Class sessions will vary and will include lectures, discussions and labs. While I appreciate that class discussion is not everyone's strong point, a course like this one will be much more exciting and engaging for all of us if it stimulates a vigorous and ongoing exchange of ideas. Most important in the course is learning by doing; the lab sessions are focused on teaching technical material in the first half, process in the second.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Course Expectations</h2> <p>Full participation in all aspects of the course is expected.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Grading</h2> <div class=\"maintabletemplate\"><table class=\"tablewidth50\" summary=\"See table caption for summary.\"> <caption class=\"invisible\">Grading criteria.</caption> <thead align=\"left\"> <tr> <th scope=\"col\">ACTIVITIES</th> <th scope=\"col\">PERCENTAGES</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody align=\"left\"> <tr class=\"row\"> <td>Attendance and participation in class</td> <td>10%</td> </tr> <tr class=\"alt-row\"> <td>Assignments</td> <td>80%</td> </tr> <tr class=\"row\"> <td>Final project</td> <td>10%</td> </tr> </tbody> </table></div> <p> </p><h2 class=\"subhead\">Required Text</h2> <p>This course has no required text.</p> <div class=\"help slide-bottom\"> <div class=\"help-message\"> <a class=\"help-engage\" href=\"javascript: trackEvents('Bottom Get Started','bottom get started Click','Help Overlay');\">Need help getting started?</a> <a href=\"javascript:disableHelpPopup(); trackEvents('Bottom Don\\'t Show','bottom don\\'t show Click','Help Overlay');\" class=\"help-dismiss\">Don't show me this again</a> </div> </div> <div class=\"help popup-center\"> <div class=\"help-message\"> <p class=\"help-dismiss\"><a href=\"javascript:disableHelpPopup(); trackEvents('Popup Don\\'t Show','popup don\\'t show Click','Help Overlay');\">Don't show me this again</a></p> <h2>Welcome!</h2> <p>This is one of over 2,200 courses on OCW.

Each team of four will individually evaluate the other three team members after the final presentation in December. Your final grade will be determined as a variation of the overall grade for the team. For example, if your team receives a B as the average grade for the semester and your teammates qualify you to have contributed to the team your personal grade for the semester will be a B+ or an A. If you slack off or minimally contribute to your teams efforts you will receive a B- or a C. Since everyone has a specific role to play on your team individual contributions should be evident at reviews.

By engaging multiple forms of representation, written and visual, students will explore methods that facilitate describing and representing their design work. Through a critical assessment of their existing portfolios, students will first be challenged to articulate design theses and interests in their past projects. Different mediums of representation will then be studied in order to hone an understanding of the relationship between form and content, and more specifically, the understanding of particular modes of representation as different filters through which their work can be read. Some of the questions that will be addressed are: </p> <ul> <li>How does one go about describing an image?</li> <li>How does one theorize representation?</li> <li>How does one articulate a design thesis in writing verses visual media?</li> <li>How can the two interact to enhance each other?</li> <li>How do different media, printed verses web publishing, affect the representation of work?</li> <li>How is your work best communicated?</li> </ul> <p>The seminar will be structured around nine meetings that will be co-taught by Mark Jarzombek and Meejin Yoon. The first 3 meetings will involve discussions around written assignments. This will be followed by a review of student portfolio work, followed by several seminars around the issues of representation. Guest lecturers will be invited to lead some of these discussions. The other assignments for the course will include both a printed and web publication of one past project or design inquiry. The meetings will be weekly, scheduled so as to not interfere with studio and final reviews. Additional tutorials will be made available to assist students who are not as familiar with desktop and web publishing tools. Students are expected to arrive with a portfolio in hand. However, the course will not be focused on the mere improvement of an existing portfolio. The students will engage the representational process as a means to provide a critical forum for written and visual communication in the field of architecture and specifically within their own work.</p> <div class=\"help slide-bottom\"> <div class=\"help-message\"> <a class=\"help-engage\" href=\"javascript: trackEvents('Bottom Get Started','bottom get started Click','Help Overlay');\">Need help getting started?</a> <a href=\"javascript:disableHelpPopup(); trackEvents('Bottom Don\\'t Show','bottom don\\'t show Click','Help Overlay');\" class=\"help-dismiss\">Don't show me this again</a> </div> </div> <div class=\"help popup-center\"> <div class=\"help-message\"> <p class=\"help-dismiss\"><a href=\"javascript:disableHelpPopup(); trackEvents('Popup Don\\'t Show','popup don\\'t show Click','Help Overlay');\">Don't show me this again</a></p> <h2>Welcome!</h2> <p>This is one of over 2,200 courses on OCW.

In fact one could argue that these two systems define architecture, both in theoretical (Laugier) and technological terms (Ashby). Contemporary building practices have fully separated these two assemblies into distinct constructs with diverse physical morphologies, performance requirements and design processes. This course will focus on these primary material systems and their respective performance attributes with an emphasis on the integration requirements and architectural potentials of the interface between the two.</p> <p>Therefore, the course will present both issues of structural design and analysis, and exterior envelope engineering. The structural portion of the course is organized through a detailed survey of the issues that govern the making of frameworks, shells and other typologies with the primary material families: metals, ceramics, polymers and composites. In addition, the limit states that govern the use of these distinct material families in load transfer scenarios will be treated separately and in detail. Through a good understanding of the properties of the material and the resulting limit states for use in architectural structures, the course will offer strategies for structural design through the making of connection details. Two topics are of particular importance; the design of primary structural members (in particular those that contribute to long span structures and other &quot;advanced structures&quot;) and the design of connections. As the physical nexus of the transfer of energy from one structural member to another, the connection becomes a tectonic moment that is regulated by the requirements of engineering and motivated by an array of architectural aspirations.</p> <p>The presentation of issues related to the performance and physical construct of the exterior envelope will be integrated into the course through the material families listed. For example, when discussing the making of structures in wood, we will address typical exterior envelope assemblies used with wood construction. Topics will include principles of exterior envelope design for a wide variety of enclosures with an emphasis on the energy performance and lifetime durability of the system. In addition, we will address the emerging codes and concerns regarding air infiltration, moisture incursion and the hygrothermal properties of exterior envelope assemblies.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Organization and Schedule</h2> <p>The calendar lists the five Phases of the course. Three problem sets are assigned during the term, due one week after they have been given. There will also be three quizzes, scheduled 12 days after the problem set is due. The timing will allow for questions from the problem sets to be fully answered and additional topics to be introduced during class. Please take advantage of this period to solidify your understanding of the material of the phase. No extensions or make up quizzes will be given except in the case of a direct conflict with religious observance, medical reasons or other unavoidable circumstance. Please inform us of any conflicts that may result in late assignments or absences beforehand, if possible.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Readings</h2> <p>Each Phase will be supported by readings from numerous texts. The readings are integral to the delivery of the course material and anything you are assigned to read can be referenced in a quiz or problem set. Readings will be given in packets comprised of excerpts from a variety of sources.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Grading</h2> <p>Grades are calculated as follows:</p> <div class=\"maintabletemplate\"> <table class=\"tablewidth50\" summary=\"See table caption for summary.\"> <caption class=\"invisible\">Grading chart.</caption> <thead align=\"left\"> <tr class=\"tableheader\"> <th scope=\"col\" abbr=\"Week Number\">ACTIVITIES</th> <th scope=\"col\">PERCENTAGES</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody align=\"left\"> <tr class=\"row\"> <td>Problem Sets</td> <td>50</td> </tr> <tr class=\"alt-row\"> <td>Quizzes</td> <td>50</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <br /> <p>No Midterm, no Final Exam.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Attendance</h2> <p>Attendance is the only way in which to fully take advantage of the material presented in this class.

The purpose of the course is to serve as an intermediate step towards the use of fabrication tools in studio and practice. The emphasis of the course is on process and application to solve real world design and fabrication problems.</p> <p>The environment is half that of a studio where larger design visions are broken into biweekly assignments using advanced modeling tools and fabrication devices. The emphasis is on design learning through in-depth studies along the four phases of professional design (schematic design, design programming, design development, and construction documentation). Advanced learning is done through hands-on tutorials, field trips and a working environment that combines research with design studio interaction.</p> <p>Projects range from small furniture design to a large scale single space. The course does not explore projects beyond 200 square feet. Course structure is composed of two studies using advance modeling software and NC devices in order to learn process.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Grading</h2> <p>Full participation in all aspects of the course is required.</p> <div class=\"maintabletemplate\"> <table class=\"tablewidth50\" summary=\"See table caption for summary.\"> <caption class=\"invisible\">Grading criteria.</caption> <thead align=\"left\"> <tr> <th scope=\"col\">ACTIVITIES</th> <th scope=\"col\">PERCENTAGES</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody align=\"left\"> <tr class=\"row\"> <td>Attendance and Participation in Class</td> <td>20%</td> </tr> <tr class=\"alt-row\"> <td>Study 1</td> <td>40%</td> </tr> <tr class=\"row\"> <td>Study 2</td> <td>40%</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> </div> <div class=\"help slide-bottom\"> <div class=\"help-message\"> <a class=\"help-engage\" href=\"javascript: trackEvents('Bottom Get Started','bottom get started Click','Help Overlay');\">Need help getting started?</a> <a href=\"javascript:disableHelpPopup(); trackEvents('Bottom Don\\'t Show','bottom don\\'t show Click','Help Overlay');\" class=\"help-dismiss\">Don't show me this again</a> </div> </div> <div class=\"help popup-center\"> <div class=\"help-message\"> <p class=\"help-dismiss\"><a href=\"javascript:disableHelpPopup(); trackEvents('Popup Don\\'t Show','popup don\\'t show Click','Help Overlay');\">Don't show me this again</a></p> <h2>Welcome!</h2> <p>This is one of over 2,200 courses on OCW.

It is also an introduction to the different work and perspectives on computation within the Computation Group.</p> <p>We will view computation and design broadly. Computation will include both computing done on the computer and computing done by-hand. Design will include the process of doing design, the people or things who/that do design, the designs themselves, and the broader environment in which design takes place.</p> <p>We will examine different approaches to computation and design from the perspective of metaphor. Metaphor is a powerful, conceptual device for structuring and thinking about an unfamiliar, new, or abstract domain of experience or knowledge (say, computation) in terms of another domain that is more familiar or concrete. We will examine the different, mostly unconscious metaphors that we use in thinking about and doing computation and design. We will look at the ways these metaphors emphasize and enable some ways of thinking about computation and design, while disabling or marginalizing others. These reflections may point us to new ways of seeing and doing computation in design.</p> <p>The aim of the course is to develop a view of computational design beyond the specifics of techniques and tools, and a critical, self-awareness of our own approaches and metaphors for computation and design.</p> <p>The semester will be divided into modules. Each module will explore a particular computational or design theme and will include a guest faculty speaker. Readings and team-based assignments will expand on the topics introduced.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Prerequisites</h2> <p>This is a required subject for first year Master of Science in Architecture Studies (SMArchS) students in Computation.

It begins with the archaeological digs into a classical past (Rome, Greece, Egypt) as well as exploratory travels into the &quot;others&quot; of Europe to examine the modern origins of architectural history itself within the profession. It ends with the contemporary era of &quot;globalization&quot; and the politics of &quot;development&quot; in the North and South and the relevance of such politics to self-titled trans-national practitioners such as Rem Koolhaas.</p> <p>The course will subsequently reprise the history of architecture through its use of contemporary ideologies, such as organicism and technology, its provenance within administrative and legal structures, the changing conditions of the practice in response to economic conditions and structures of production, and their role in shaping and understanding social and aesthetic processes at large. Topics cover a wide range of debates on color, drawing, ornament, structure, construction, material, inhabitation, gender, class, race, nationalism, etc. in architecture.</p> <p>In setting up these constraints, the course will also focus on aspects of architectural theory, historiography, and design in their complicity and resistance with texts of power, specifically with regard to the immense transformations wrought in different cultural contexts by colonial, industrial and post-industrial expansions, and the complicity of the ideas of European modernism in securing these arenas. The course therefore seeks to establish new conceptual relationships between canonical themes of modernity framed within a certain &quot;Europe&quot; in relation to the emergence of a global modernity in the world at large. The course explores modern architectural history and buildings through thematic exposition rather than as simple chronological succession of ideas.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Requirements</h2> <ol> <li>Weekly Assignments: 1 page response to readings and questions, due on weekends (9 required).<br /> <br /> </li> <li>Class Presentation.<br /> <br /> </li> <li>Final Paper with original research content.</li> </ol> <div class=\"help slide-bottom\"> <div class=\"help-message\"> <a class=\"help-engage\" href=\"javascript: trackEvents('Bottom Get Started','bottom get started Click','Help Overlay');\">Need help getting started?</a> <a href=\"javascript:disableHelpPopup(); trackEvents('Bottom Don\\'t Show','bottom don\\'t show Click','Help Overlay');\" class=\"help-dismiss\">Don't show me this again</a> </div> </div> <div class=\"help popup-center\"> <div class=\"help-message\"> <p class=\"help-dismiss\"><a href=\"javascript:disableHelpPopup(); trackEvents('Popup Don\\'t Show','popup don\\'t show Click','Help Overlay');\">Don't show me this again</a></p> <h2>Welcome!</h2> <p>This is one of over 2,200 courses on OCW.

It is a writing-intensive class based on the premise that writing and editing are forms of critical thinking. The syllabus outlines the structure of the course and the readings and assignments for each week.</p> <p>The discipline of art history periodically surges into &quot;crisis.&quot; The demise of formalism as a guiding tenet, or connoisseurial appreciation as a general guide, plunged the field into confusion during the 1970s when the battle raged over &quot;social histories of art&quot; or &quot;revisionism;&quot; in the late 1990s the debate was staged between &quot;visual studies&quot; versus &quot;normative art history.&quot; The course takes this confusion as itself worthy of study, and seeks to make available some of the new methodologies that have emerged over the past two decades. The ultimate goal is to bring students closer to discovering their own individual methods and voices as writers of art historical prose. In broader terms, we will attempt to understand the historiography of visual art and images more broadly. Our efforts will be predicated on the conviction that art history can serve as a generative discipline for all humanistic disciplines, and even those that style themselves as &quot;Bildwissenschaft&quot; (or &quot;image-science&quot;).</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Assignments</h2> <p>Each week, at least two students will have the responsibility of initiating discussion of the assigned readings. They will present briefly the central arguments and conclusions of each piece and raise leading questions. In developing these informal weekly presentations, you are encouraged to work together; it is also helpful to bring in images or objects on which given methods of analysis can be practiced. Additionally, each of you will be expected to write, analyze, and edit your own prose as well as the writing of others, trying on different styles and methodologies as you work toward a final paper. I feel strongly that the best scholarship comes from an open, sharing, and collaborative environment that encourages diverse approaches and conclusions; therefore, we will also read each others' essays (including my own), and comment on them as a group.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Grades</h2> <p>Grades will be based on class participation and leadership in discussion (20%), class essays and exercises (30%), and final paper (50%).</p> <div class=\"help slide-bottom\"> <div class=\"help-message\"> <a class=\"help-engage\" href=\"javascript: trackEvents('Bottom Get Started','bottom get started Click','Help Overlay');\">Need help getting started?</a> <a href=\"javascript:disableHelpPopup(); trackEvents('Bottom Don\\'t Show','bottom don\\'t show Click','Help Overlay');\" class=\"help-dismiss\">Don't show me this again</a> </div> </div> <div class=\"help popup-center\"> <div class=\"help-message\"> <p class=\"help-dismiss\"><a href=\"javascript:disableHelpPopup(); trackEvents('Popup Don\\'t Show','popup don\\'t show Click','Help Overlay');\">Don't show me this again</a></p> <h2>Welcome!</h2> <p>This is one of over 2,200 courses on OCW.

In this subject, you will have an opportunity to develop projects that are responsive to real-world problems, using solutions that depend on biological technologies. Through interactive lectures and studio time, you will learn techniques, strategies and vocabulary to enable the engineering of your synthetic biological system. These will be gained by considering:</p> <ul> <li>how biology can be made easier to engineer, including the use of DNA synthesis, standards, and abstraction in biological engineering</li> <li>the consequences of success, introducing issues of human practice, including (a) biological safety, (b) security, (c) ownership, sharing, &amp; innovation, and (d) ethics</li> <li>the clever solutions that nature has found to solve physical challenges, specifically examining the components that control cellular behavior</li> <li>the ways nature innovates, examining the evolution and reuse of good components as well as the reboot of living systems after catastrophic collapse</li> </ul> <p>It is hoped this subject will provide an engaging introduction for would-be biological engineers as well as a foundational framework for anyone interested in the responsible and reliable programming of genetic material.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Introducing Synthetic Biology</h2> <h3 class=\"subsubhead\">Poetry</h3> <blockquote> <p>Not long ago when biology meant<br /> looking and prodding and fixing what's bent<br /> there were armies of scientists working away<br /> to list what they found<br /> and to know life's display</p> <p>But not all was well as they tried to discover<br /> how life could be programmed since some but not other<br /> experiments worked and each person designed<br /> their template for learning<br /> as they were inclined</p> <p>&quot;Share!&quot; said the engineers &quot;and try to remember<br /> that others will use your work only whenever<br /> the tools you develop are standard and simple<br /> think of most screwthreads and<br /> think of the wheel.</p> <p>Maybe in this way life by design<br /> could work out of the box and others will find<br /> lots of interesting ways to build up from the bottom<br /> making useful new parts<br /> then new systems.

A series of topics are covered, some of which change from year to year, to illustrate the functioning of biological networks. The lectures present examples of complex pathways (chemotaxis, nitrogen fixation, lactation, cytokine mediated intercellular signaling, apoptosis, etc.). In each case emphasis is placed on how these pathways are regulated at the molecular, cellular and tissue levels.</p> <p>There are two examinations during the course, which have the goal of preparing BE graduate students for their qualifying examinations. The principal product of the course is a student team-generated grant proposal. The topic this year is the design of experiments that probe unique aspects of the biochemical networks associated with apoptosis. Students prepare for their topic both out of class and in class during recitations (we plan to teach three hours per week and reserve about one hour for discussion). After each framing session, students go to the literature and flesh out their ideas as topics for a grant proposal. They present their ideas to the class in Power Point format during the framing sessions. After the ideas are fleshed out, the students jointly write their grant proposal. Each student writes a section of the proposal that is identified as their own.</p> <p>Readings are in the form of primary scientific papers, reviews, and selected chapters from texts.</p> <p>The proposal is written in the <a href=\"http://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2004/nsf042/start.htm\">NSF format</a> or in that used by investigators applying for a grant from the National Institutes of Health.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Course Description</h2> <p>Complex biological processes are analyzed from the molecular, cellular, extracellular, and organ levels of hierarchy. Emphasis is placed on the basic biochemical and biophysical principles that govern these processes. Examples of processes to be studied include chemotaxis, the fixation of nitrogen into organic biological molecules, growth factor and hormone mediated signaling cascades, and signaling cascades leading to cell death in response to damage. In each case, the availability of a resource, or the presence of a stimulus, results in some biochemical pathways being turned on while others are turned off. The course examines the dynamic aspects of these processes.</p> <p>Building on a foundation of knowledge of pathway biochemistry (including kinetics and thermodynamics), we examine the molecular switches that dynamically trigger responses at the transcriptional, translational and protein-activity levels of control. While the objective of the course is not to teach about specific diseases, the course sometimes discusses diseases of animals or plants as teaching tools to understand how pathway disruptions can lead to readily observed phenotypes. Examples could include diabetes mellitus, mucopolysaccharidosis, ataxia telangiectasia, cystic fibrosis, cholesterol biosynthesis, hormone dependent cancers, and defective response to growth hormones in plants. Additionally, however, basic phenomena such as how concentration gradients trigger motion in the direction of or away from a stimulus are studied and, as appropriate, modeled. This course details how biochemical mechanistic themes impinge on molecular-cellular-tissue-organ level functions. Thus the goal is to provide a chemical and quantitative view of the interplay of multiple pathways as biological networks.</p> <p>Course organization involves didactically taught classes dealing with the aforementioned topics, complemented by a class project. Early in the term, the class is brought up to the same level through analysis of topics not taught in detail in the MIT undergraduate biological chemistry courses. Nitrogen fixation into amino acids and nucleotides is covered as a thermodynamically highly favored, yet sluggish and energy consumptive, process that is central to all life. Only a few species of plants in symbiotic relationships with a few species of bacteria fix nitrogen. Nitrogen from ammonia is tracked into amino acids, affording the opportunity to refresh the studentâs ability to use organic chemistry to work through a complex pathway. The mechanisms by which nitrogen fixation and introduction into organic molecules is regulated are emphasized. Amino acids are sometimes used as molecular attractants in chemotaxis experiments. The switch of bacterial motion from random to directional is analyzed. Other topics covered include the pathway by which lactation occurs, apoptosis, blood coagulation, intercellular trafficking, cell signaling, and others.</p> <p>The following texts are used (but not required) and supplemented with readings from the primary literature:</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/047119350X/ref=nosim/mitopencourse-20\"><img alt=\"Buy at Amazon\" src=\"/images/a_logo_17.gif\" align=\"absMiddle\" border=\"0\" /></a> Voet, Donald and Judith G.

San Francisco, CA: Benjamin Cummings, 2003. ISBN: 9780131423381.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Recitations</h2> <p>Regular weekly attendance is expected. Each recitation section meets twice per week for 50 minutes.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Tutors</h2> <p>Tutors are available at no charge for all students who wish to have extra help with the course material, either on a one-time or on a regular basis.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Voluntary Laboratory</h2> <p>This semester is the second time we are offering a voluntary lab component as an exciting addition to 7.012.</p> <p>The purpose of the labs is to give you a hands-on experience with the organisms, equipment, techniques, and thought process used by molecular biologists. You will have the opportunity to do experiments for yourselves, and a chance to learn the concepts that are addressed in lecture and section from a different angle. Experiments will include:</p> <ul> <li>Isolating your own DNA</li> <li>Generating and Finding Mutant Yeast</li> <li>Performing Gene Therapy on Mutant Yeast</li> <li>Setting up Yeast Matings</li> <li>Screening Household Products for Carcinogens</li> </ul> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Assignments</h2> <p>There are six problem sets for this course. Of the six graded problem sets, the lowest grade is dropped in calculating your final grade (see below). The last problem set, Problem Set 7, will not be graded, however, the material on this problem set will be covered on the Final Exam. Although you may engage in general discussions of problems, sharing of answers is a violation of the trust placed in all students in the class, each of whom is entrusted with producing her/his own set of answers. Students who copy problem set answers or allow their problem sets to be copied may receive a 0 for all the Problem Sets (and thus lose 20% of the grade).</p> <p>Completed problem sets must be put in the appropriate TA's box in the wooden cart by the due date/time.</p> <p>Note: Problem sets will not be accepted late and will be scored ZERO points if not turned in on time.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Exams</h2> <p>Three quizzes and a final exam are given in this course. The quizzes are given during the term and a comprehensive final (worth 2 quizzes), given during finals week.</p> <p>Each of the term quizzes will take place in at least two locations, on the dates listed in the syllabus. See Quiz handouts for room assignments. The lowest letter grade score of the five (the 3 quizzes plus the final worth 2 quizzes) will be dropped when calculating your overall grade. Because we drop the lowest score, there will be <strong>no make-up quizzes</strong> and <strong>no conflict quizzes</strong> given for any reason. If you miss a term quiz, it will be the score that is dropped.</p> <p>The Final Exam is a 3-hour, cumulative exam, covering the entirety of the course. The score on the final exam will be halved and each half counts as a quiz score when calculating your grade. The final represents two of the five quiz scores and <strong>must be taken</strong>, otherwise you lose 20% of your grade. If your score on the final is your lowest grade then one of the halves will be dropped.</p> <p>The date, time, and location of the final will be announced as soon as this information is available. A <strong>conflict final exam may be scheduled</strong> by the registrar for students with legitimate exam conflicts.</p> <p><strong>Quiz Review Sessions</strong> will be held prior to each quiz -- the dates, locations and times of the reviews will be announced during the term.</p> <p>Any quizzes, exams, or problem sets that are not picked up by the end of the term will be disposed of.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Grades</h2> <div class=\"maintabletemplate\"> <table class=\"tablewidth100\" summary=\"See table caption for summary.\"> <caption class=\"invisible\">Table for Grading</caption> <thead align=\"left\"> <tr class=\"tableheader\"> <th id=\"col1\" scope=\"col\" abbr=\"Week Number\">ACtivities</th> <th id=\"col2\" scope=\"col\">percentages</th> <th id=\"col3\" scope=\"col\">notes</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody align=\"left\"> <tr class=\"row\"> <td headers=\"col1\">5 of 6 Graded Problem Sets</td> <td headers=\"col2\">20%</td> <td headers=\"col3\">Lowest of 6 problem set scores dropped</td> </tr> <tr class=\"alt-row\"> <td headers=\"col1\">4 of 5 Quizzes</td> <td headers=\"col2\">80%</td> <td headers=\"col3\">Lowest grade of &quot;five&quot; quizzes dropped (3 one-hour quizzes during term plus the 2 quiz scores derived from the Final Exam, whose score will be divided in two, each half counting as one quiz score)</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> </div> <div class=\"help slide-bottom\"> <div class=\"help-message\"> <a class=\"help-engage\" href=\"javascript: trackEvents('Bottom Get Started','bottom get started Click','Help Overlay');\">Need help getting started?</a> <a href=\"javascript:disableHelpPopup(); trackEvents('Bottom Don\\'t Show','bottom don\\'t show Click','Help Overlay');\" class=\"help-dismiss\">Don't show me this again</a> </div> </div> <div class=\"help popup-center\"> <div class=\"help-message\"> <p class=\"help-dismiss\"><a href=\"javascript:disableHelpPopup(); trackEvents('Popup Don\\'t Show','popup don\\'t show Click','Help Overlay');\">Don't show me this again</a></p> <h2>Welcome!</h2> <p>This is one of over 2,200 courses on OCW.

Some research experience and/or 7.02 (Introduction to Experimental Biology and Communication) are advantageous for students in the course, as it is heavily focused on experiments. We assume that you are thoroughly familiar with the material in chapters 1-4 and 9 of the textbook <em>Molecular Cell Biology</em> by Lodish, et al. before taking this course. If you are having problems with this introductory material, please see your teaching assistant or one of the course professors.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Textbook</h2> <p>The required textbook for this course is:</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0716743663/ref=nosim/mitopencourse-20\"><img alt=\"Buy at Amazon\" align=\"absMiddle\" border=\"0\" src=\"/images/a_logo_17.gif\" /></a> Lodish, et al. <em>Molecular Cell Biology</em>. 5th ed. New York, NY: W.H. Freeman and Company, 2003. ISBN: 9780716743668.</p> <p>Chapters 1 through 4 and the genetic and molecular techniques described in Chapter 9 are essential and required background knowledge for the course. You should also be very familiar with the material in these 5 chapters before you take 7.06. Reviewing these 5 chapters will give you a good sense for whether you have adequate background to take this course.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Recitations</h2> <p>There is one required recitation per week.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Grading</h2> <p>Your overall course grade will be an average of your four exam scores. All exam scores count equally. No exam score will be dropped.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Quizzes</h2> <p>There will be three quizzes worth 100 points each given during the term, and one quiz worth 100 points given during finals week. The fourth exam for the class is not cumulative in terms of material/information covered on the other three exams. However, you will be held responsible for the experimental techniques that we discuss throughout the course, which can be applied when studying a wide range of topics. Quiz Review Sessions will be held prior to each quiz.</p> <p>If you feel that your answer was graded incorrectly, please submit a written explanation of your regrade request to the course professor. Please note that all quizzes are photocopied before they are returned to the students. Quizzes must be submitted for regrading by the deadlines announced in class.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Problem Sets</h2> <p>This course includes four problem sets. They will not be graded.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Intellectual Honesty</h2> <p>We hope and trust that academic misconduct will not occur during this course. We nevertheless want to emphasize that we will be rigorous in our enforcement of Biology Department and Institute rules. It is the policy of the Department to keep a record of all cases of academic misconduct and to forward cases to the Dean of Undergraduate and Student Affairs. To guard against the possibility that dishonesty will go undetected, we will xerox all exams and regrade exams from these xerox copies.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Calendar</h2> <p>The calendar below provides information on the course's lecture (L) and exam (E) sessions.</p> <div class=\"maintabletemplate\"> <table class=\"tablewidth50\" summary=\"See table caption for summary.\"> <caption class=\"invisible\">Course calendar.</caption> <thead align=\"left\"> <tr> <th scope=\"col\">SES #</th> <th scope=\"col\">TOPICS</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody align=\"left\"> <tr class=\"row\"> <td>L1</td> <td>Road map of course, what is and what is not cell biology, properties and behaviors of cells</td> </tr> <tr class=\"alt-row\"> <td>L2</td> <td>Structure of biological membranes, lipids and lipid modification, membrane proteins</td> </tr> <tr class=\"row\"> <td>L3</td> <td>Pumps, channels, transporters</td> </tr> <tr class=\"alt-row\"> <td>L4</td> <td>Receptors, basics of signal transduction (Note: Reprise and extension in lecture 14)</td> </tr> <tr class=\"row\"> <td>L5</td> <td>Protein secretion, biogenesis of membrane proteins</td> </tr> <tr class=\"alt-row\"> <td>E1</td> <td>Exam I (lectures 1-5)</td> </tr> <tr class=\"row\"> <td>L6</td> <td>Regulation of the cell division cycle</td> </tr> <tr class=\"alt-row\"> <td>L7</td> <td>Regulation of DNA replication</td> </tr> <tr class=\"row\"> <td>L8</td> <td>The microtubule cytoskeleton</td> </tr> <tr class=\"alt-row\"> <td>L9</td> <td>Regulation of mitosis</td> </tr> <tr class=\"row\"> <td>L10</td> <td>Meiosis</td> </tr> <tr class=\"alt-row\"> <td>L11</td> <td>Cell cycle checkpoints</td> </tr> <tr class=\"row\"> <td>E2</td> <td>Exam II (lectures 6-11)</td> </tr> <tr class=\"alt-row\"> <td>L12</td> <td>Protein modifications and intracellular transport, glycosylation, vesicular transport, receptor mediated endocytosis, lysosomes, organelle biogenesis</td> </tr> <tr class=\"row\"> <td>L13</td> <td>Protein modifications and intracellular transport II</td> </tr> <tr class=\"alt-row\"> <td>L14</td> <td>Signal transduction: Detailed molecular mechanisms</td> </tr> <tr class=\"row\"> <td>L15</td> <td>Nerve cells, ion channels, synapse, Ca<sup>++</sup> regulated events</td> </tr> <tr class=\"alt-row\"> <td>L16</td> <td>Nerve cells II</td> </tr> <tr class=\"row\"> <td>L17</td> <td>Immunity and host pathogen interactions I</td> </tr> <tr class=\"alt-row\"> <td>L18</td> <td>Immunity and host pathogen interactions II</td> </tr> <tr class=\"row\"> <td>E3</td> <td>Exam III (lectures 12-18)</td> </tr> <tr class=\"alt-row\"> <td>L19</td> <td>The actin-myosin cytoskeleton</td> </tr> <tr class=\"row\"> <td>L20</td> <td>The extracellular matrix</td> </tr> <tr class=\"alt-row\"> <td>L21</td> <td>Cancer I</td> </tr> <tr class=\"row\"> <td>L22</td> <td>Cancer II</td> </tr> <tr class=\"alt-row\"> <td>L23</td> <td>Stem cells and cloning</td> </tr> <tr class=\"row\"> <td>E4</td> <td>Exam IV (lectures 19-23)</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> </div> <div class=\"help slide-bottom\"> <div class=\"help-message\"> <a class=\"help-engage\" href=\"javascript: trackEvents('Bottom Get Started','bottom get started Click','Help Overlay');\">Need help getting started?</a> <a href=\"javascript:disableHelpPopup(); trackEvents('Bottom Don\\'t Show','bottom don\\'t show Click','Help Overlay');\" class=\"help-dismiss\">Don't show me this again</a> </div> </div> <div class=\"help popup-center\"> <div class=\"help-message\"> <p class=\"help-dismiss\"><a href=\"javascript:disableHelpPopup(); trackEvents('Popup Don\\'t Show','popup don\\'t show Click','Help Overlay');\">Don't show me this again</a></p> <h2>Welcome!</h2> <p>This is one of over 2,200 courses on OCW.

Teams of 2 or 3 students will design and carry out experiments to address questions about the genes involved in the regulation and execution of PCD in this system.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Texts and Materials</h2> <p>There are no required text books. Relevant papers, protocols and other information will be provided in course binders or made available on the course web site.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Structure of Class</h2> <p>Students break into teams of 2 or 3. For the first three weeks, all teams will work on the Common Project (P0), which involves inducing cell death in S2 cells by depleting the mRNA of the DIAP1 gene, which represses apoptosis.</p> <p>During this time, each team chooses a Team Project from the list provided or devises their own Team Project. Each team then researches this project and writes up a proposal - incorporating suggestions from the writing instructor - describing a set of experiments that will be done to address a question about the mechanism or regulation of apoptosis. This proposal is due at the end of session 14.</p> <p>The teams then revise these proposals in response to comments from the instructors. The rest of the class is devoted to carrying out the experiments described in the proposals, and writing up the results. Teams present their results at weekly lab meetings, held every Friday starting in session 15.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Assignments</h2> <p>There are three written assignments:</p> <ul> <li> <div>The Team Project Proposal</div> </li> <li> <div>The Minireview Paper</div> </li> <li> <div>The Final Paper</div> </li> </ul> <p>Written assignments must be turned in <strong>on the</strong> <strong>due date at the start of the class</strong> to be eligible for full credit.

UROP is MIT's <a href=\"http://web.mit.edu/urop/\">Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program</a>. Although research is carried out in different labs, the regular meetings in class will provide the same educational opportunities and training as those offered by the Project Labs. The goals of this course are to learn the following:</p> <ul> <li> how to present research, both orally and in writing </li> <li> the mechanics of writing papers and abstracts </li> <li> how to read and critique papers </li> <li> how to analyze and critique research </li> </ul> <p>These sessions will provide an opportunity to</p> <ol> <li> communicate your findings to your peers, </li> <li> receive help and constructive criticism of your work, and </li> <li> critique others' work. </li> </ol> <p>A significant component of 7.18 will be the <strong>writing tutorial</strong>, which will provide both general and specific training in writing a scientific report.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Prerequisites and Requirements</h2> <p>7.18 has the same prerequisites (7.02 - Experimental Biology and Communication, 7.03 - Genetics, 7.05 -Biochemistry) and the same number of units (24) as the three project labs (7.13, 7.16, 7.17) offered by the Biology Department. The written assignments for 7.18 will be the same as for other project labs and will include a 15-page research report.</p> <p>Students should only enroll in 7.18 if they plan to complete a paper on their research by the last day of class in the semester they are enrolled. A student who is planning to work in a lab for several semesters before writing a paper should plan to enroll in 7.URG. A minimum of a one semester enrollment in 7.URG (or full time work over the summer) in the proposed laboratory is required before a student is eligible to enroll in 7.18. While enrolled in 7.18, students should plan that the number of hours they are working in the lab are sufficient for progress of their project to completion. <strong>It is recommended that students are in lab 16-20 hours a week</strong>.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Oral Presentations and Journal Paper Discussions</h2> <p>At the beginning of the semester, every student will give a 5-min/3-slide presentation of his/her research project, using lay language and focusing on overall objectives (big picture).</p> <p>During the second class period, every student will submit four primary scientific papers directly relevant to his/her research project. Some of the papers will be chosen for in-class discussion. The student whose paper is chosen will lead the paper discussion. He or she will meet with the instructors in advance to go over the paper. The rest of the students, i.e., those who do not lead the paper discussion, will need to write a one-page summary of the paper.</p> <p>The summary (2 copies) will be collected and evaluated for scientific content and writing. The papers that are discussed in class will provide materials for writing tutorial.</p> <p>For the remainder of the semester, the class will meet to discuss specific research projects and their progress. Students will present their research projects, results, and problems. The class as a whole will critique the project and troubleshoot problems. Every student is expected to give two presentations on his or her research project. The presentation will form the basis for the final 15-page research report due at the end of the semester.</p> <p><strong>Two</strong> hard copies of all assignments must be submitted to the instructors.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Final Paper and Supporting Documents</h2> <p>One goal of the course is that you write a research article, following <strong>standard IMRAD format</strong> (Introduction, Material and Methods, Results, and Discussion). Each section will first be submitted separately. (Figures will be submitted with the Results section.) You will receive comments for revision from your instructors and a peer reviewer. The complete draft is a revision and joining together of the individual sections. The final paper is a second draft.</p> <p>Some of you may not have enough results to write up a paper. In this case, you may, instead, work on a grant proposal. Please speak to the instructors.</p> <p>You will be asked to assemble a cumulative file of documents as an underpinning for your research article. Some of the documents you need to collect; others you will write.</p> <ul> <li> <strong>Instructions to authors</strong> <ul> <li> Choose a likely journal to which you might submit your final paper (e.g., Cell). Photocopy or print out Instructions to Authors and highlight anything of interest to you. </li> </ul> </li> <li> <strong>Summaries</strong> <ul> <li> We will read and discuss several âmodelâ articles in class. For each, unless you are the person presenting the article, please submit a one-page summary as described. </li> </ul> </li> <li> <strong>Annotated bibliography</strong> <ul> <li> Write two or three sentences describing each of about ten articles that will be included in your final bibliography. Consider how the article applies to your own work. </li> </ul> </li> <li> <strong>Figure critique</strong> <ul> <li> Analyze the figures from one of the model papers. Interpret and evaluate the figures. </li> </ul> </li> <li> <strong>Glossary</strong> <ul> <li> List alphabetically, and define, about ten terms you are using in your paper with which your readers may be unfamiliar. </li> </ul> </li> <li> <strong>Nonscientific abstract</strong> <ul> <li> Write a one-page abstract of your paper addressed to a general audience. </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>Supporting documents will include an &quot;Instructions to Authors&quot; sheet from a selected journal, your journal article summaries, an annotated bibliography, a figure critique, glossary, and a nonscientific abstract.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Grades</h2> <div class=\"maintabletemplate\"> <table class=\"tablewidth75\" summary=\"See table caption for summary.\"> <caption class=\"invisible\">Grading criteria.</caption> <thead align=\"left\"> <tr class=\"alt-row\"> <th id=\"tbl589id0_0\" scope=\"col\">ACTIVITIES</th> <th id=\"tbl589id0_1\" scope=\"col\">PERCENTAGES</th> <th id=\"tbl589id0_2\" scope=\"col\">NOTES</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody align=\"left\"> <tr class=\"row\"> <td headers=\"tbl589id0_0\">Class Participation</td> <td headers=\"tbl589id0_1\">20%</td> <td headers=\"tbl589id0_2\">Three presentations and participation in the class discussion.</td> </tr> <tr class=\"alt-row\"> <td headers=\"tbl589id0_0\">Writing Assignments</td> <td headers=\"tbl589id0_1\">10%</td> <td headers=\"tbl589id0_2\">All writing assignments, including paper summaries.</td> </tr> <tr class=\"row\"> <td headers=\"tbl589id0_0\">Research Report</td> <td headers=\"tbl589id0_1\">70%</td> <td headers=\"tbl589id0_2\">35% of the grade will be based on the faculty mentor's evaluation of lab performance, research progress, and quality of the written report; 35% will be based on the course instructor's evaluation of the final 15-page research report.

A particular emphasis is the intimate connection between developmental biology and evolution, which will be a theme throughout the course. Additional emphasis is on the connection between mechanisms of normal development and disease etiology. The course will cover general principles of development and current important issues. Relevant ethical issues will be discussed. Both invertebrate and vertebrate model systems will be covered, including Drosophila, C. elegans, chick, frog, zebrafish, mice and human.</p> <p>The course will be divided into multiple topics, each of which will be covered by two hours of lecture and two hours of discussion of research papers. In some cases, guest lecturers working in a specific area will teach a topic. One review article and one research paper will be handed out one week ahead of time and will be relevant to that week's lecture topic. Groups of students will be responsible for leading discussion of research papers. Instruction on how to structure these discussions will be given.</p> <p>Another emphasis of the course is to teach you how to experimentally approach the topics of development. We will therefore emphasize how to formulate and test hypotheses. Students will become familiar with cutting edge molecular, genetic and imaging techniques that are applicable to analysis of many aspects of development.</p> <p>Finally, since development is a three (and four) dimensional subject, modeling materials will be used in some sessions. We will also discuss current news and movies relevant to the lecture material. Prof. Sive will offer an optional additional discussion module using the book <em>Jurassic Park</em> as a tool to approach ethical and experimental issues in developmental biology research.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Recommended Texts and Other Readings</h2> <p>The following book is a very useful text, and recommended. Selected readings will be suggested for some topics.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0878932585/ref=nosim/mitopencourse-20\"><img alt=\"Buy at Amazon\" src=\"/images/a_logo_17.gif\" align=\"absMiddle\" border=\"0\" /></a> Gilbert, Scott F. <em>Developmental Biology</em>. 7th ed. Sunderland, MA: Sinauer Associates, 2003. ISBN: 9780878932580.</p> <p>Background will be provided for students who have not studied development before, and MicrosoftÂ® PowerPointÂ® presentations will be made accessible to the class.</p> <p>See the <a href=\"/courses/biology/7-22-developmental-biology-fall-2005/readings\">readings</a> section for a complete list of recommended texts.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Assignments</h2> <p>Assignments for both undergraduate and graduate students include presenting primary literature material and leading weekly paper discussions for the class. Undergraduate students also must complete two exams and a final exam. Graduate students must complete a written review of a recent paper as a final project.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Course Requirements</h2> <h3 class=\"subsubhead\">All Students</h3> <p>Active participation is expected, and questions are encouraged in both lecture and paper review sessions. However, do not be intimidated - you are here to learn! NaÃ¯ve questions are encouraged and no question will be considered stupid. It is also expected that you will have read and considered all papers before the discussion session.</p> <p>You will be asked to keep a written record of techniques relevant to specific questions as the course proceeds. We will give you clear guidelines about how to put together such a compendium of techniques, which will serve as a useful future reference.</p> <h3 class=\"subsubhead\">Graduate Students</h3> <p>Pass/Fail. Attendance at all classes, active participation in class, and leading discussions as assigned is expected, as well as completion of the final project.</p> <h3 class=\"subsubhead\">Undergraduate Students</h3> <p>The course will be graded or can be taken Pass/Fail. Attendance at all classes, active participation in class, and leading discussions as assigned is expected. Two exams will be given during the semester, during recitation times or at some other mutually acceptable time. A final will be given during exam week. Practice exam material will be available. Exams will strongly emphasize formulation of hypotheses and design of experimental approaches to test these.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Grading</h2> <h3 class=\"subsubhead\">Graduate Students</h3> <p>This course is graded on a pass/fail basis for graduate students.</p> <h3 class=\"subsubhead\">Undergraduate Students</h3> <div class=\"maintabletemplate\"> <table class=\"tablewidth50\" summary=\"See table caption for summary.\"> <caption class=\"invisible\">Grading criteria.</caption> <thead align=\"left\"> <tr class=\"alt-row\"> <th scope=\"col\">ACTIVITIES</th> <th scope=\"col\">DISTRIBUTION</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody align=\"left\"> <tr class=\"row\"> <td>Class Attendance, Participation, and Student Led Discussion Sessions</td> <td>1/3</td> </tr> <tr class=\"alt-row\"> <td>Two Exams</td> <td>1/3</td> </tr> <tr class=\"row\"> <td>Final Exam</td> <td>1/3</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> </div> <div class=\"help slide-bottom\"> <div class=\"help-message\"> <a class=\"help-engage\" href=\"javascript: trackEvents('Bottom Get Started','bottom get started Click','Help Overlay');\">Need help getting started?</a> <a href=\"javascript:disableHelpPopup(); trackEvents('Bottom Don\\'t Show','bottom don\\'t show Click','Help Overlay');\" class=\"help-dismiss\">Don't show me this again</a> </div> </div> <div class=\"help popup-center\"> <div class=\"help-message\"> <p class=\"help-dismiss\"><a href=\"javascript:disableHelpPopup(); trackEvents('Popup Don\\'t Show','popup don\\'t show Click','Help Overlay');\">Don't show me this again</a></p> <h2>Welcome!</h2> <p>This is one of over 2,200 courses on OCW.

Each exam will be weighted equally, and therefore constitute 33.3% of your final grade (optional writing assignments can also contribute, see below). Material covered on each exam will be based principally on the new material presented since the previous exam, however, the course is designed to build on previously presented techniques and concepts and the exams will reflect this organization. Absence from an exam will be accepted only if an excuse is obtained from the Medical Department (or another physician) or with an excuse approved by the Dean's office. You must contact one of the course professors prior to the exam for an excused absence. If there is a conflict with the scheduled time of the final exam, see one of the professors.</p> <p>There will be a problem set covering the material for each exam. These will not be graded, but the questions appearing on the problem sets will be very similar in depth and difficulty to those appearing on the exams. Therefore, working the problem sets (without reading the answers first!) is strongly recommended.</p> <p>For each third of the course, one research article related to the material covered in lecture will be assigned. Everyone should read these papers; they will be discussed in recitation and related questions may appear on the exams. With each paper, we will also hand out a discussion question. Students are encouraged to write a brief essay (2 double spaced pages) in response to this question. Essays will receive up to 15 pts and will be graded based on the completeness of answer, clarity of explanation and originality. Course grades will be calculated based exclusively on exam scores. Points accumulated from completing the writing assignments will then be added to the exam totals. Grades will then be assigned without altering the point totals corresponding to each letter grade. Thus, the writing assignments will be treated as extra credit.</p> <div class=\"help slide-bottom\"> <div class=\"help-message\"> <a class=\"help-engage\" href=\"javascript: trackEvents('Bottom Get Started','bottom get started Click','Help Overlay');\">Need help getting started?</a> <a href=\"javascript:disableHelpPopup(); trackEvents('Bottom Don\\'t Show','bottom don\\'t show Click','Help Overlay');\" class=\"help-dismiss\">Don't show me this again</a> </div> </div> <div class=\"help popup-center\"> <div class=\"help-message\"> <p class=\"help-dismiss\"><a href=\"javascript:disableHelpPopup(); trackEvents('Popup Don\\'t Show','popup don\\'t show Click','Help Overlay');\">Don't show me this again</a></p> <h2>Welcome!</h2> <p>This is one of over 2,200 courses on OCW.

Would you like to try teaching, but are nervous about whether you will be any good at it? Are you interested in new research on science education? If so, 7.391 is the course for you!</p> <p>7.391 is a weekly seminar on science education open to both graduate and undergraduate students. Participants will read primary literature on science education, uncover basic concepts often overlooked when teaching biology, and lead a small weekly discussion session for students in MIT course 7.02. Students will be encouraged to review lecture material posted on the web for 7.014 or attend review sessions for 7.02 to obtain a first-hand view of the material being covered. Current students will be paired with mentors from last semester's course.</p> <p>Research in science education shows that the greatest obstacle to student learning is the failure to identify and confront the misconceptions with which the students enter the class or those that they acquire during their studies. This course focuses on developing the participants' ability to uncover and confront student misconceptions and to foster student understanding and retention of key concepts.</p> <p>Participants are encouraged to remain in the program as mentors for the fall semester.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Course Format</h2> <p>The course will have three components, reading primary literature in science education, discussing key concepts in select areas of biology, and leading a discussion group for the students taking Introductory Biology lab or lecture (7.014 or 7.02).</p> <p>We will discuss at least one original paper each week. The papers must be read in advance of the class. Our goal will be to critically analyze these papers. To help us achieve that goal, each of you will be expected to email to the instructor two discussion questions for the article covered that day by the morning of the class. In discussing the papers, we will focus on articulating the main points of the paper, identifying conditions under which the data was collected and assumptions used in interpreting the data, and discussing how the results could be applied to the teaching environment at MIT.</p> <p>Starting in the third week of class, seminar participants will lead a small (no more than 5 students) discussion groups for students enrolled in 7.014 or 7.02. There will be one session of each discussion group a week and each session will last approximately an hour. A mentor from last semester's class will be partnered with you to help facilitate the discussion. Students leading discussions for 7.02 will be required to attend bi-weekly meetings with the 7.02 staff to orient themselves with the material to be presented. Students leading discussions for 7.014 will be asked to attend lecture if possible or review old lecture material.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Attendance</h2> <p>This is a discussion class, so attendance is mandatory. You are allowed to miss one of the 15 sessions of the class, but please notify the instructors ahead of time. You will also need to arrange to pick up the paper for the next week from the course instructor. If you need to miss a second class, you must talk to the instructors ahead of time so we can arrange an appropriate make-up assignment.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Assignments</h2> <p>Class participants are required to lead a discussion session with currently enrolled introductory biology students. There are writing assignments based on preparation work for these discussion sessions. Participants will also be required to give several oral presentations on class readings and run a selected concept discussion during a portion of the seminar.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Grading</h2> <p>The course is pass/fail. Participation in class discussion, completion of the assignments above, and satisfactory attendance will result in a passing grade.</p> <div class=\"help slide-bottom\"> <div class=\"help-message\"> <a class=\"help-engage\" href=\"javascript: trackEvents('Bottom Get Started','bottom get started Click','Help Overlay');\">Need help getting started?</a> <a href=\"javascript:disableHelpPopup(); trackEvents('Bottom Don\\'t Show','bottom don\\'t show Click','Help Overlay');\" class=\"help-dismiss\">Don't show me this again</a> </div> </div> <div class=\"help popup-center\"> <div class=\"help-message\"> <p class=\"help-dismiss\"><a href=\"javascript:disableHelpPopup(); trackEvents('Popup Don\\'t Show','popup don\\'t show Click','Help Overlay');\">Don't show me this again</a></p> <h2>Welcome!</h2> <p>This is one of over 2,200 courses on OCW.

Fridlund, and Daniel Reisberg. <em>Psychology</em>. 6th ed. New York, NY: Norton, 2004. ISBN: 0393977676.</p><h2 class=\"subhead\">About This Course</h2><p>&quot;Psychology is the study of human behavior and human mental life.&quot; That is the first line (or a close approximation of the first line) of most Introductory Psychology texts. That line describes an immense territory that includes single cells in the brain, your memories of childhood, the motivations of terrorists, and the nature of dreams...for starters. This course is an introduction. We can't hope to exhaust the topic but we can show you the lay of the land and invite you to continue exploring when the course is done.</p><h2 class=\"subhead\">The Text</h2><p>I picked the Gleitman et al. Psychology text because it has been the best written, most intelligent of the texts on the market for many years. The book has many pages. Students who discover this fact the day before the exam are usually unhappy. The text is most useful when read in small quantities over the course of the term. This year, I have provided handouts with some questions and notes to help you to focus on the points that I consider most important.</p><p>Please Note: We expect you to have done the reading by the date listed on the syllabus. More precisely, we assume that you will show up in recitation having done the assigned reading. Thus, if Chapter 3 is assigned for session 2, you can be quizzed on it on next day. Timing is bit less stringent for a chapter that is assigned for a Thursday. Since all recitation fall between the Tuesday and Thursday lectures, you have the weekend to read the chapter.</p><p>FAQ: The book is out in its 6th edition. Can you use the 5th that you found cheap somewhere?</p><p>Answer: Yes but don't fuss if some factoid on the exam turns out to be in the 6th but not the 5th. It is your choice but there is a risk.</p><h2 class=\"subhead\">The Lectures</h2><p>Lectures are scheduled two days a week, each of one and a half hour duration. I think that lectures and recitations are the reason for taking the course at a place like MIT. You can read the book anywhere. You can take video lectures out of the library. I am a live person as is your TA. Ask questions and get involved. I will be happy to try to respond to raised hands during lecture. Respond to our questions. Engage with the material.</p><p>There will be a handout for most lectures. If I finish my summer project, these will be a bit more substantial than in years past but they are not intended as a substitute for attending lecture. If you miss a lecture, you should talk to a friend in the class so that you will be able to decipher the handout.</p><p>FAQ: If I miss a lecture or recitation should I find the professor or TA and ask &quot;Did I miss anything <strong>important</strong>?&quot;</p><p>Answer: Be aware that this question, phrased in this manner, has been known to provoke sarcastic answers from faculty (&quot;No, we saw you were not there and realized that we could not discuss anything of substance today.&quot;) However, it is just fine to ask if the material covered was similar to the material outlined in the handout.</p><h2 class=\"subhead\">The Recitation Sections</h2><p>The Registrar's clever computers will put you into a recitation. They will all fall between the Tuesday and Thursday lectures. They are NOT optional. You are expected to be there. Your recitation instructor has primary responsibility for grading your work. Moreover, there are things that we can do in small groups that we cannot do in the 200-300 person lecture. Be there.</p><h2 class=\"subhead\">The Highly Sophisticated Grading Algorithm</h2><p>You will be graded on four written assignments, a midterm, a final and some quizzes. Here is the formula that will form the basis for your grade:</p><div class=\"maintabletemplate\"><table class=\"tablewidth50\" summary=\"See table caption for summary.\"><caption class=\"invisible\">Gradings Table.</caption><thead align=\"left\"><tr class=\"alt-row\"><th scope=\"col\">ACTIVITIES</th><th scope=\"col\">PERCENTAGES</th></tr></thead><tbody align=\"left\"><tr class=\"row\"><td>Papers</td><td>50%</td></tr><tr class=\"alt-row\"><td>Midterm Exam</td><td>15%</td></tr><tr class=\"row\"><td>Final Exam</td><td>25%</td></tr><tr class=\"alt-row\"><td>Other Stuff Including Section Participation Oral Presentation, and Quizzes</td><td>10%</td></tr></tbody></table></div><h2 class=\"subhead\">The Writing Assignments</h2><p>There are four writing assignments this year. You have some freedom in scheduling when you do them but you would be well-advised to spread the work over the term in a fairly even manner. The assignments are described in a separate handout.</p><h3 class=\"subsubhead\">Some Notes about Writing</h3><ul><li>Length: The desired length of these papers is given in the handouts. We are not going to sit around counting words BUT 350 words is not the same as 1000 words <strong>even if you use a big font</strong> and 2000 words is not twice as good as 1000 if we asked for 1000.</li><li>Citations: Remember, if you use someone's ideas, give them credit by means of a citation (Franklin, 1776). The basic rules are a) You are not likely to get in trouble for having too many citations and b) it should be possible to track down the source of any assertion in your paper. If the source isn't you, let us know who it is. If you use someone's exact words, &quot;put them in quotes&quot; (Lincoln, 1864).<br /><br />Read Me! <strong>Use your own words:</strong> This is important and, for some reason, some people don't get it. Most of the Dangerously Bad Papers in this class are cut-and-paste collages. These are papers that are made up of direct quotes or close paraphrases of your sources. Even if the citations and bibliography are flawless, this is not a good way to write. Worse, people tend to forget the citations and then this looks like plagiarism (see below). We want your OWN WORDS. Use direct quotation sparingly. Read, think, and then write. You have been warned.</li><li>Honesty: Every now and then someone turns in work that is not their own. Plagiarism occurs when one person tries to take credit for the ideas or work of another. Fake data is academic fraud. Plagiarism is academic theft. We regard this very seriously. All of this is easier to detect than one might think (I could tell you some great stories). Academic dishonesty is grounds for failing the course and for referral to the Committee on Discipline.<br /><br />Accidental plagiarism is easy to avoid. Let's say you found some good ideas in a book. You can use those ideas in your own paper; just make sure to tell us the source. You can even use the same words (sparingly...see above.) Just make sure that they are in &quot;quotes&quot; and the source identified. We find that people do stupid things like plagiarizing when they are confused or in some last-minute panic. Try not to get into that state. Talk to us if you are having trouble with any part of the course. We feel sorry for people who come in with sad stories about how they came to plagiarize. We feel sorry, but they still fail.</li><li>Writing Help: As a CI course, 9.00 has three writing tutors assigned to it to help with your papers. To request an appointment with one of the tutors, send an email at least 48 hours in advance of your desired meeting-time. Tutors can help at any stage of the writing process, but can be most helpful if you provide them with a complete rough draft. Send your draft to the tutor (as an email attachment) at least 48 hours before your scheduled meeting. In past years, students have found that using the writing tutors have helped them significantly raise their paper grade.</li><li>Deadlines: Deadlines are real. The value of papers declines monotonically after the deadline. That said, I have been teaching for quite a while and I know that people will miss deadlines. A late paper is almost always worth <strong>significantly</strong> more than no paper. Moreover, if you know you are going to be late, it is always better to tell me about it in advance. We hate surprises. Can you imagine what a warrior your mother would have been? Umm... speaking of surprises, that last bit was a quotation (without quotation marks...oops). It was inserted to see who actually reads the syllabus. If you found this line, tell me. First person to identify the source &quot;wins&quot;.</li><li>Communication Requirement/Writing Requirement: As a HASS CI (CI-H) class, 9.00 gives freshmen and sophomores CI-H credit towards the Communication Requirement (if you pass the course!) Note that students who received grades of &quot;Writing Subject Required&quot; on the FEE will NOT receive CI-H credit for 9.00 unless they have previously completed an approved expository writing subject.<br /><br />As with anything else in this class, if you are confused, stuck, lost, curious, or whatever - talk to us. Don't just guess that you have the right idea. That can be a recipe for disaster.</li></ul><h2 class=\"subhead\">An Oral Presentation</h2><p>Because this is a CI course, you will be making at least one oral presentation to the class. This presentation is 2 minutes long and will be on some aspect of the current assigned reading that you found interesting. Names will be drawn randomly (with no replacement - you only have to do it once) during section to choose the speakers. That means you should be in section. If you are not there and your name comes out of the hat (or whatever), your grade could be affected.</p><h2 class=\"subhead\">The Exams</h2><p>The course will have a midterm (1 hour) two days after session 11 and a final (3 hours) during finals week. Exams are closed-book (and slightly strange). Note: Please don't schedule your flight home until you know the dates of your exams.</p><h2 class=\"subhead\">Quizzes</h2><p>There might be a quiz in your recitation section on any given week. It will be based on the current assigned reading. One of their functions is benignly coercive. We wish to persuade you to do some of the reading more than 24 hrs before the exam.</p><h2 class=\"subhead\">A Final Note</h2><p>It may strike you as somewhat unusual that Intro. Psych. is being taught by a Professor of Ophthalmology from the Harvard Medical School. Trust me, you are much better off having me as your Psychology Professor than as your ophthalmologist. All of my undergraduate (Princeton) and graduate (MIT) training is in Psychology. I have been teaching some version of this course at MIT since 1981. In my research life, I run the Visual Attention Lab. It is part of Brigham and Women's Hospital.</p> <div class=\"help slide-bottom\"> <div class=\"help-message\"> <a class=\"help-engage\" href=\"javascript: trackEvents('Bottom Get Started','bottom get started Click','Help Overlay');\">Need help getting started?</a> <a href=\"javascript:disableHelpPopup(); trackEvents('Bottom Don\\'t Show','bottom don\\'t show Click','Help Overlay');\" class=\"help-dismiss\">Don't show me this again</a> </div> </div> <div class=\"help popup-center\"> <div class=\"help-message\"> <p class=\"help-dismiss\"><a href=\"javascript:disableHelpPopup(); trackEvents('Popup Don\\'t Show','popup don\\'t show Click','Help Overlay');\">Don't show me this again</a></p> <h2>Welcome!</h2> <p>This is one of over 2,200 courses on OCW.

New York, NY: HarperPerennial, 1993.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Course Description</h2> <h3 class=\"subsubhead\">Overview</h3> <p>There exist many statistical techniques useful for research in Brain and Cognitive Sciences. This course covers the most basic and least controversial of these techniques, including z-tests, t-tests, correlation, ANOVA, and a number of non-parametric statistical tests. The goal is to give the student an understanding of the intuitions behind statistical testing, and not merely the mechanics of performing the tests, as well as to cover basics of probability and of good experimental design.</p> <h3 class=\"subsubhead\">Homework</h3> <p>Homework consists of problem solving and practice performing statistical tests. Many of the homework assignments involve some programming in MATLABÂ®. For a first class in statistics more insights into what the test is doing are gained by having the student do the necessary computations themselves, rather than rely upon statistical packages.</p> <p>Because of the importance of the homework assignments, they form a substantial proportion of the grade for this class.</p> <h3 class=\"subsubhead\">Midterm and Final Exam</h3> <p>The exams will focus on concepts, require minimal computation, and will not require a calculator or computer. Students may not have access to the same computational resources during an exam, and this policy is designed to make the exams as fair as possible.</p> <h3 class=\"subsubhead\">Class Participation</h3> <p>Class attendance is extremely important. If the instructor and TA recognize a student as attending regularly, this will add 5% to the student's grade, which can be enough to raise a student's letter grade.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Course Evaluation</h2> <div class=\"maintabletemplate\"> <table class=\"tablewidth50\" summary=\"See table caption for summary.\"> <caption class=\"invisible\">Grading Table</caption> <thead align=\"left\"> <tr class=\"alt-row\"> <th scope=\"col\">aCTIVITIES</th> <th scope=\"col\">PERCENTAGES</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody align=\"left\"> <tr class=\"row\"> <td>Class Participation</td> <td>5%</td> </tr> <tr class=\"alt-row\"> <td>Homework</td> <td>40%</td> </tr> <tr class=\"row\"> <td>Midterm</td> <td>20%</td> </tr> <tr class=\"alt-row\"> <td>Final Exam</td> <td>35%</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> </div> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Academic Honesty</h2> <p>Students are expected to adhere to strict standards of academic honesty.</p> <p>Students may get together in groups to discuss the homework, provided that they specify, at the top of their assignment, who was in their group. However, each student <strong>must solve each problem themselves (including writing their own MATLABÂ® code), and write up the solutions themselves</strong>. It is <strong>never</strong> acceptable to copy from someone else's solution, and this will result in 0 points for the problem in question and, depending upon the extent of the violation, in some cases 0 points for the assignment. Since it is often difficult to tell who copied from whom, students are strongly advised not to let anyone else copy off of their homework.</p> <p>Students are expected not to make use of solutions or assignments from previous years.</p> <p>During quizzes and exams, exchange of information with others is unacceptable. So is the use of notes or other materials, unless explicitly authorized. Students will not be allowed to use calculators or computers.</p> <p>Anyone suspected of violating these guidelines may be charged with academic dishonesty and subject to MIT's disciplinary procedures.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Policy on Late Assignments</h2> <p>Short extensions may be granted due with a reasonable excuse (MIT sporting event, wedding, job interview, etc.), provided the instructor or TAs are notified on or before the day the homework is assigned.</p> <p>For more unforeseen difficulties, an extension may also be granted, provided we receive a letter from the student's doctor, Counseling and Support Services, or equivalent. However, students should notify the instructor and TAs informally as soon as they are aware of the potential problem.</p> <div class=\"help slide-bottom\"> <div class=\"help-message\"> <a class=\"help-engage\" href=\"javascript: trackEvents('Bottom Get Started','bottom get started Click','Help Overlay');\">Need help getting started?</a> <a href=\"javascript:disableHelpPopup(); trackEvents('Bottom Don\\'t Show','bottom don\\'t show Click','Help Overlay');\" class=\"help-dismiss\">Don't show me this again</a> </div> </div> <div class=\"help popup-center\"> <div class=\"help-message\"> <p class=\"help-dismiss\"><a href=\"javascript:disableHelpPopup(); trackEvents('Popup Don\\'t Show','popup don\\'t show Click','Help Overlay');\">Don't show me this again</a></p> <h2>Welcome!</h2> <p>This is one of over 2,200 courses on OCW.

Our goal in this class is for each student to learn enough molecular skills to be able to perform experiments successfully in future settings.</li> <li>Each week we will begin class with a brief overview of the technique covered that day. We will then employ this experimental technique for the remainder of the class period.<br /> <br /> </li> </ul> </li> <li>Paper Presentations <ul> <li>Each week we will review one paper that elaborates on ideas and techniques that are pertinent to the molecular neuroscience topic of that week.</li> <li>We will randomly select three to four students to each present a specific figure from that paper. In addition students will also utilize these figures to discuss the general molecular technique used to collect the figure data and to explain how this technique applies to the paper overall.</li> <li>Each student will present figures from two papers this semester.</li> </ul> </li> </ol> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Writing</h2> <p>Students will have many opportunities to write this semester, for this course fulfills one of the CI-M requirements for course 9 majors.</p> <ol> <li>Paper Questions - Assigned each Week <div> <ul> <li>Professors Lois and Hayashi will provide the class with six to eight specific questions related to a presentation paper. Students will receive these questions after each presentation and will have one week to answer these questions and to submit these answers for grading.</li> <li>Presenters and non-presenters alike will have to submit answers to these questions.<br /> <br /> </li> </ul> </div> </li> <li>Review Essays - Two per Semester <div> <ul> <li>Students will write a three-page summary and critical review of a scientific paper.</li> <li>These essays will be evaluated in two ways. First a scientific writer will analyze the structure, and then the teaching assistant (TA) will analyze the content. The scientific writer will provide feedback that you will use to revise your essay before submitting your paper to the teaching assistant for grading.<br /> <br /> </li> </ul> </div> </li> <li>Lab Reports - Four per Semester <div> <ul> <li>Students will write a brief (two page) lab report using data collected in the wet lab. These papers can use data from one or many lab weeks, depending on the topics covered.</li> <li>Lab reports consist of a few basic components. <ol> <li>Introduction: provides an overview of background related to your experiment, how your experiment fits into this background, and your experimental hypothesis for the paper.</li> <li>Methods: describes techniques/methods used in an experiment and how one collects data from the experiment.</li> <li>Results: describes the outcome of the experiment using text and figures.</li> <li>Discussion: relates the experimental results to the hypothesis and to the overall field of research and explains experiment outcomes, errors, and future directions.</li> </ol> </li> </ul> </div> </li> </ol> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Additional Information</h2> <ol> <li>Laboratory Notebooks <ul> <li>We will provide students with laboratory notebooks. In the course of performing experiments, you will learn how to properly record methods and data. In general, your lab notebook should be self-explanatory. That is, the notebook should be complete and well organized so that others could use it to accurately repeat your experiments.</li> <li>We will periodically evaluate and grade your notebook for content, presentation and organization in order to help you to learn these record-keeping techniques.<br /> <br /> </li> </ul> </li> <li>Presentations <ul> <li>Each student will have two opportunities to give oral presentations this semester. Figure presentations by each student should last approximately fifteen minutes. We expect students to give computer-based presentations (using MicrosoftÂ® PowerPointÂ®, etc.).</li> <li>We will grade you not only on the information that you present, but also on your ability to convey the information. Some points to remember when giving your presentation: <ul> <li>Speak to your audience; make frequent eye contact.</li> <li>Speak slowly, clearly and loudly.</li> <li>Present the information on the screen so that it is large enough for all to see it. Typically one has more slides with less text with this method. Remember the common rule of one slide per minute.</li> <li>Avoid filler words when speaking. Common fillers include, &quot;um&quot;, &quot;ah&quot; and &quot;like&quot;.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p dir=\"ltr\"></p> <ul> <li>Feel free to contact the teaching assistants or the lab manager for help with any of these points. Practicing in front of a smaller audience can help you when you face a larger one.<br /> <br /> </li> </ul> </li> <li>Participation <div> <ul> <li>We will grade your participation in both the lab sessions and in the presentation sessions.</li> <li>Participation in the lab means that you have read and understand the protocol for the week, that you perform your experiments to the best of your ability, and that you are actively learning techniques in the lab.</li> <li>Participation in the presentation means that you have read and understand the paper for the week and that you are prepared to answer questions if asked.<br /> <br /> </li> </ul> </div> </li> <li>End of the Year Quiz <div> <ul> <li>In lieu of a paper presentation the last Wednesday of classes, there will be a class quiz. This quiz will consist of approximately 400 questions given orally in a round-robin manner. We will use this tool to show you all how much information you have acquired over the course of the term.<br /> <br /> </li> </ul> </div> </li> <li>Lab Safety <div> <ul> <li>While it is important for you all to learn the molecular techniques that we will teach you this semester, it is equally important that you all are safe while performing these tasks.If you have any questions about lab safety, please contact any of the teaching staff. Additional safety information for this course will not be discussed here, but is placed in the <a href=\"/courses/brain-and-cognitive-sciences/9-12-experimental-molecular-neurobiology-fall-2006/labs\">labs</a> section.

We focus on monoamine transmitters (acetylcholine; serotonin; dopamine and norepinephrine); we also examine amino acid and peptide transmitters and neuromodulators like adenosine. Macromolecules that mediate neurotransmitter synthesis, release, inactivation and receptor-mediated actions are discussed, as well as factors that regulate their activity and the second-messenger systems and ion fluxes that they control. The involvement of particular neurotransmitters in human diseases is considered.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Required Text</h2> <p><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0195140087/ref=nosim/mitopencourse-20\"><img alt=\"Buy at Amazon\" src=\"/images/a_logo_17.gif\" align=\"absMiddle\" border=\"0\" /></a> Cooper, Jack R., Floyd E.

Are our concepts innate, or are they acquired by experience? (And what does it even mean to call a concept 'innate'?) Are 'mental images' pictures in the head? Is color in the mind or in the world? Is the mind nothing more than the brain? Can there be a science of consciousness? The course will include guest lectures by Professors.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Prerequisites</h2> <p>None. Introductory material on the relevant parts of psychology and neuroscience will be given as we proceed.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Guest Lectures</h2> <p>As part of our effort to convey the truly interdisciplinary nature of many philosophical issues abut the mind, we have invited six distinguished philosophers and cognitive scientists, whose work overlaps both fields, to give guest lectures to the class. The topics of these guest lectures have been arranged to dovetail with the lectures by us.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Course Readings</h2> <p>Reading, discussing, and writing about the assigned readings are the central activities of this class. (No outside research will be necessary.) There is a reading assignment for each lecture. Some are (a) very difficult, or (b) very long, or (c) both. All demand careful study. You should complete the assigned readings <strong>before</strong> each lecture as the lecture will often presuppose familiarity with the material in the texts.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Course Grading, Assignments, Exams</h2> <h3 class=\"subsubhead\">20% Recitation Grade</h3> <p>Recitation evaluation will be based on attendance, preparation, contributions to discussion, and any written or oral assignments, including: 2 argument analysis exercises (2-3 pages). (The two exercises together must total at least <strong>five</strong> pages.)</p> <h3 class=\"subsubhead\">60% 3 5-page Papers</h3> <p>Paper topics will be distributed in advance and will ask students to analyze and discuss material covered in class. Guidelines for papers will be handed out in class. (The three papers together must total at least <strong>fifteen</strong> pages.) <strong>Either the first or second paper must be rewritten and resubmitted</strong> (this is <strong>required</strong> of all students to fulfill the CI requirement). You are <strong>strongly advised</strong> to rewrite your first paper. Your grade for the revised paper will be the average of the grades for the two versions. (Note that revised papers are held to a higher standard.)</p> <h3 class=\"subsubhead\">20% Final Exam</h3> <p>You will be required to take a 3-hour final exam on material covered throughout the term. The final exam will be at least 2/3 essay format, and essay questions will be distributed in the final lecture of the term. The exam will be closed-notes and closed-books. (There is no midterm exam.) The instructors reserve the right to fail any student in the course who fails to perform at a passing level in any of the grading areas listed above; so, for example, attendance at recitation is required and consistent failure to attend will result in an F for the course.</p> <p> </p><div class=\"maintabletemplate\"><table class=\"tablewidth50\" summary=\"See table caption for summary.\"> <caption class=\"invisible\">Grading criteria.</caption> <thead align=\"left\"> <tr> <th scope=\"col\">ACTIVITIES</th> <th scope=\"col\">PERCENTAGES</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody align=\"left\"> <tr class=\"gray-row\"> <td>Problem sets</td> <td>20%</td> </tr> <tr class=\"white-row\"> <td>Mid term I</td> <td>25%</td> </tr> <tr class=\"gray-row\"> <td>Mid term II</td> <td>25%</td> </tr> <tr class=\"white-row\"> <td>Final exam</td> <td>30%</td> </tr> </tbody> </table></div> <p> </p><h2 class=\"subhead\">Criteria for HASS CI Subjects</h2> <p>Communication intensive subjects in the humanities, arts, and social sciences should <strong>require at least 20 pages of writing</strong> divided among 3-5 assignments. Of these 3-5 assignments, at least one should be revised and resubmitted. HASS CI subjects should further offer students substantial opportunity for oral expression, through presentations, student-led discussion, or class participation. As this is a CI subject, the <strong>oral component</strong> is essential. Active participation in both lectures and (especially) recitations is required. Students will be asked to give oral presentations on the reading in recitation.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">MIT Statement on Plagiarism</h2> <p>Plagiarismâuse of another's intellectual work without acknowledgementâis a serious offense. It is the policy of the Literature Faculty that students who plagiarize will receive an F in the subject, and that the instructor will forward the case to the Committee on Discipline. Full acknowledgement for all information obtained from sources outside the classroom must be clearly stated in all written work submitted. All ideas, arguments, and direct phrasings taken from someone else's work must be identified and properly footnoted. Quotations from other sources must be clearly marked as distinct from the student's own work. For further guidance on the proper forms of attribution, consult the style guides available at the <a href=\"http://cmsw.mit.edu/writing-and-communication-center/\">Writing and Communication Center</a> and the <a href=\"http://cmsw.mit.edu/writing-and-communication-center/avoiding-plagiarism/\">MIT Web site on Plagiarism</a>.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">How to Cite a Source</h2> <p>If your paper discusses a single essay assigned for the course, and if you make clear what essay that is in the body of the text, then you may cite the essay by putting the page number (section number if the essay is in html) of the quotation in parentheses next to the stretch of text. For example: In his essay, &quot;What is a Neural Correlate of Consciousness?&quot;, David Chalmers offers an account of when a state of a system is a neural correlate of a certain phenomenal property. According to Chalmers, &quot;A state N1 of system N is a neural correlate of phenomenal property P if N's being in N1 directly correlates with the subject having P.&quot; (9) If you use a source not assigned for the course, include the full reference for the source in a bibliography and at the point in the text where you need to cite the source, put the author's last name, date of publication, and page number, for example (Chomsky 1978, 75).</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Calendar</h2> <div class=\"maintabletemplate\"><table class=\"tablewidth75\" summary=\"See table caption for summary.\"> <caption class=\"invisible\">Course calendar.</caption> <thead align=\"left\"> <tr> <th scope=\"col\">SES #</th> <th scope=\"col\">TOPICS</th> <th scope=\"col\">KEY DATES</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody align=\"left\"> <tr class=\"gray-row\"> <td>1</td> <td>Intro to perception</td> <td> </td> </tr> <tr class=\"white-row\"> <td>2</td> <td>Basic psychophysics</td> <td> </td> </tr> <tr class=\"gray-row\"> <td>3</td> <td>Eye, retina</td> <td> </td> </tr> <tr class=\"white-row\"> <td>4</td> <td>Eye, retina (cont.)</td> <td>Problem set 1 due 4 days after Ses #4</td> </tr> <tr class=\"gray-row\"> <td>5</td> <td>Spatial vision</td> <td> </td> </tr> <tr class=\"white-row\"> <td>6</td> <td>Spatial vision (cont.)</td> <td> </td> </tr> <tr class=\"gray-row\"> <td>7</td> <td>Mid-level vision</td> <td> </td> </tr> <tr class=\"white-row\"> <td>8</td> <td>Mid-level vision (cont.)</td> <td> </td> </tr> <tr class=\"gray-row\"> <td>9</td> <td>Object recognition</td> <td>Problem set 2 due</td> </tr> <tr class=\"white-row\"> <td>10</td> <td>Face recognition</td> <td> </td> </tr> <tr class=\"gray-row\"> <td>11</td> <td>Mid term I</td> <td> </td> </tr> <tr class=\"white-row\"> <td>12</td> <td>Color and lightness</td> <td>Problem set 3 due</td> </tr> <tr class=\"gray-row\"> <td>13</td> <td>Depth</td> <td> </td> </tr> <tr class=\"white-row\"> <td>14</td> <td>Binocular vision</td> <td> </td> </tr> <tr class=\"gray-row\"> <td>15</td> <td>Motion</td> <td> </td> </tr> <tr class=\"white-row\"> <td>16</td> <td>Motion (cont.)</td> <td> </td> </tr> <tr class=\"gray-row\"> <td>17</td> <td>Scenes</td> <td> </td> </tr> <tr class=\"white-row\"> <td>18</td> <td>The ear</td> <td> </td> </tr> <tr class=\"gray-row\"> <td>19</td> <td>Mid term II</td> <td>Problem set 4 due 5 days after Ses #19</td> </tr> <tr class=\"white-row\"> <td>20</td> <td>Audition</td> <td> </td> </tr> <tr class=\"gray-row\"> <td>21</td> <td>Audition (cont.)</td> <td>Problem set 5 due</td> </tr> <tr class=\"white-row\"> <td>22</td> <td>Music and speech</td> <td>Problem set 6 (part 1) due 5 days after Ses #22</td> </tr> <tr class=\"gray-row\"> <td>23</td> <td>Touch</td> <td> </td> </tr> <tr class=\"white-row\"> <td>24</td> <td>Haptics</td> <td>Problem set 6 (full) due 1 day after Ses #24</td> </tr> <tr class=\"gray-row\"> <td>25</td> <td>Smell</td> <td> </td> </tr> <tr class=\"white-row\"> <td>26</td> <td>Taste, last day of classes</td> <td> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table></div> <div class=\"help slide-bottom\"> <div class=\"help-message\"> <a class=\"help-engage\" href=\"javascript: trackEvents('Bottom Get Started','bottom get started Click','Help Overlay');\">Need help getting started?</a> <a href=\"javascript:disableHelpPopup(); trackEvents('Bottom Don\\'t Show','bottom don\\'t show Click','Help Overlay');\" class=\"help-dismiss\">Don't show me this again</a> </div> </div> <div class=\"help popup-center\"> <div class=\"help-message\"> <p class=\"help-dismiss\"><a href=\"javascript:disableHelpPopup(); trackEvents('Popup Don\\'t Show','popup don\\'t show Click','Help Overlay');\">Don't show me this again</a></p> <h2>Welcome!</h2> <p>This is one of over 2,200 courses on OCW.

The final paper (Paper 3) is a research article about an experiment with two-factors, with controls (related to Project 2, about 4500 words).</p> <p>Problem sets consist of 4 CogLab reports (2-3 pages each) and 1 Science newspaper article on your project. CogLabs are short experiments (5 to 15 min.).</p> <p>All papers are written individually. All research projects are done in groups of 1-3 students.</p> <h3 class=\"subsubhead\">Attendance</h3> <p>You have two free late days (24 hour periods each) that you may use between Paper 1 and Paper 2 as needed. Please notify us if you are taking late days. After you have used up your late days, you will lose 5% per day on an assignment. If you turn in anything over 3 days late, we do not guarantee that we will be able to grade it. Please be sure to talk to us as soon as possible in any such case; we don't want to hand out any grades of 0! Paper 3 (final paper) must be turned in on time, no exceptions, so that we can get the grades in on time. CogLab data and reports must be turned in on time, no exceptions. The data is important to your classmates who are presenting and it is vital that you not get behind on turning in these short experiments.</p> <h3 class=\"subsubhead\">Grading</h3> <div class=\"maintabletemplate\"><table class=\"tablewidth75\" summary=\"See table caption for summary.\"> <caption class=\"invisible\">Grading criteria.</caption> <thead align=\"left\"> <tr> <th scope=\"col\">ACTIVITIES</th> <th scope=\"col\">POINTS (104 POINTS)</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody align=\"left\"> <tr class=\"row\"> <td>Paper 1 (Literature review)</td> <td>10</td> </tr> <tr class=\"alt-row\"> <td>Paper 2 (Experiment 1)</td> <td>10</td> </tr> <tr class=\"row\"> <td>Paper 3 (Final)</td> <td>15</td> </tr> <tr class=\"alt-row\"> <td>4 CogLab summaries</td> <td>20 (5 points per CogLab)</td> </tr> <tr class=\"row\"> <td>Science newspaper article</td> <td>5</td> </tr> <tr class=\"alt-row\"> <td>Oral presentation of literature review (Paper 1)</td> <td>4</td> </tr> <tr class=\"row\"> <td>Oral presentation of experiment 1 (Paper 2)</td> <td>4</td> </tr> <tr class=\"alt-row\"> <td>Oral presentation of experiment 2 (Paper 3)</td> <td>4</td> </tr> <tr class=\"row\"> <td>Oral presentation of CogLab</td> <td>4</td> </tr> <tr class=\"alt-row\"> <td>Mid-term exam (in class)</td> <td>20</td> </tr> <tr class=\"row\"> <td>Participation in class</td> <td>8</td> </tr> </tbody> </table></div> <h2 class=\"subhead\">MIT Literature Statement on Plagiarism</h2> <p>Plagiarismâuse of another's intellectual work without acknowledgementâis a serious offense.

Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is the only method that enables us to monitor local neural activity in the normal human brain in a noninvasive fashion and with good spatial resolution. A large number of far-reaching and fundamental questions about the human mind and brain can now be answered using straightforward applications of this technology. This is particularly true in the area of high-level vision, the study of how we interpret and use visual information including object recognition, mental imagery, visual attention, perceptual awareness, visually guided action, and visual memory.</p> <p>The goals of this course are to help students become savvy and critical readers of the current neuroimaging literature, to understand the strengths and weaknesses of the technique, and to design their own cutting-edge, theoretically motivated studies. Students will read, present to the class, and critique recently published neuroimaging articles, as well as write detailed proposals for experiments of their own. Lectures will cover the theoretical background on some of the major areas in high-level vision, as well as an overview of what fMRI has taught us and can in future teach us about each of these topics. Lectures and discussions will also cover fMRI methods and experimental design. A prior course in statistics and at least one course in perception or cognition are required.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Required Reading</h2> <p><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0878932887/ref=nosim/mitopencourse-20\"><img align=\"absMiddle\" border=\"0\" src=\"/images/a_logo_17.gif\" alt=\"Buy at Amazon\" /></a> Huettel, Scott A., Allen W.

Principles derived while surveying these systems are applied to later lectures describing the most recent findings in learning, memory, sleep, and cognition.</p> <p>Each module of the course involves a series of overview lectures by a leading researcher in the field, complemented by recitation opportunities on primary research papers for students. By offering a thorough introduction to the current status of the discipline while emphasizing critical thinking, 9.011 aims to prepare students for an exciting and rapid beginning to their contributions as neuroscientists.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Format</h2> <p>Class runs for 3 hours. The first 2.5 hours will be lecture, while during the last 15-30 minutes a student will lead a discussion on a related research paper.</p> <p>Every class all students will be responsible for a written summary of that day's research paper, and one student will be responsible for offering a presentation to lead a discussion on that paper. The main work for the course consists of coming to class having done the reading and prepared the summary.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Reading</h2> <p>Zigmond, Michael, ed. <em>Fundamental Neuroscience</em>. 1st ed.

It develops basic tools such as regularization, including support vector machines for regression and classification. It derives generalization bounds using both stability and VC theory. This course discusses current research topics such as boosting, feature selection, active learning, ranking, and online learning. It also examines applications in several areas: computer vision, computer graphics and bioinformatics. The final projects, hands-on applications, and exercises are designed to illustrate the rapidly increasing practical uses of the techniques described throughout the course.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Prerequisites</h2> <p>18.02, 9.641J, 6.893 or permission of instructor. In practice, a substantial level of mathematical maturity is necessary. Familiarity with probability and functional analysis will be very helpful. We try to keep the mathematical prerequisites to a minimum, but we will introduce complicated material at a fast pace.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Grading</h2> <p>There will be two problem sets, a MATLABÂ® assignment, and a final project.

In the context of 10.302, this means that if you consult with others (such as fellow students, TA's, faculty) in the process of completing homework, you must acknowledge their contribution in any way that reflects their true ownership of the ideas and methods you borrowed.</p> <p>Discussion among students to understand the homework problems or to prepare for laboratories or quizzes is encouraged. Copies of previous year's problems and quizzes (&quot;bibles&quot;) will be made available and are considered useful in the educational process. <strong>Collaboration on homework is allowed as long as all references (both literature and people) used are named clearly at the end of the assignment.</strong> Word-by-word copies of someone else's solution or parts of a solution handed in for credit will be considered cheating unless there is a reference to the source for any part of the work which was copied verbatim. <strong>Failure to cite other student's contribution to your homework solution will be considered cheating.</strong> Official Institute policy regarding academic honesty can be found in the MIT Bulletin Course and Degrees Issue under &quot;Academic Procedures and Institute Regulations.&quot;</p> <p>Study groups are considered an educationally beneficial activity. However, at the end of each problem on which you collaborated with another student you must cite the students and the interaction. The purpose of this is to acknowledge their contribution to your work. Some examples follow:</p> <ol> <li>You discuss concepts, approaches and methods that could be applied to a homework problem before either of you start your written solution. This process is encouraged. You are not required to make a written acknowledgment of this type of interaction.<br /> </li> <li>After working on a problem independently, you compare answers with another student, which confirms your solution. You should acknowledge that the other student's solution was used to check your own. No credit will be lost if the solutions are correct and the acknowledgments is made.<br /> </li> <li>After working on a problem independently, you compare answers with another student, which alerts you to an error in your own work. You should state at the end of the problem that you corrected your error on the basis of checking answers with the other student. No credit will be lost if the solution is correct and the acknowledgment is made, and no direct copying of the correct solution is involved.<br /> </li> <li>You and another student work through a problem together exchanging ideas as the solution progresses. Each of you should state at the end of the problem that you worked jointly. No credit will be lost if the solutions are correct and the acknowledgment is made.<br /> </li> <li>You copy all or part of a solution from a reference such as a textbook or a &quot;bible.&quot; You should cite the reference. Partial credit will be given, since there is some educational value in reading and understanding the solution. However, this practice is strongly discouraged, and should be used only when you are unable to solve the problem without assistance.<br /> </li> <li>You copy verbatim all or part of a solution from another student. This process is prohibited. You will receive no credit for verbatim copying from another student when you have not made any intellectual contribution to the work you are both submitting for credit.<br /> </li> <li><strong>Verbatim copying of any material which you submit for credit without reference to the source is considered to be academically dishonest.</strong></li> </ol> <div class=\"help slide-bottom\"> <div class=\"help-message\"> <a class=\"help-engage\" href=\"javascript: trackEvents('Bottom Get Started','bottom get started Click','Help Overlay');\">Need help getting started?</a> <a href=\"javascript:disableHelpPopup(); trackEvents('Bottom Don\\'t Show','bottom don\\'t show Click','Help Overlay');\" class=\"help-dismiss\">Don't show me this again</a> </div> </div> <div class=\"help popup-center\"> <div class=\"help-message\"> <p class=\"help-dismiss\"><a href=\"javascript:disableHelpPopup(); trackEvents('Popup Don\\'t Show','popup don\\'t show Click','Help Overlay');\">Don't show me this again</a></p> <h2>Welcome!</h2> <p>This is one of over 2,200 courses on OCW.

There will be two one-hour exams, one approximately mid term and the other during finals weeks. No exams will be dropped. Homework is the key to success here, despite the relatively low direct value in grade weighting. Without serious effort on the homework, the exams will be very difficult.</p> <p>Cooperation among the student is encouraged within the following guidelines. Try the homework individually. If you get stuck, discuss it with your colleagues or the TAs or your instructors, and proceed individually. Individual effort is necessary for you to develop an effective problem solving strategy, which is essential to good exam performance and to succesful professional practice later on.

They will be graded and returned the following week. <strong>Homework policy and honor code</strong>: While students are encouraged to discuss problem solutions and strategies, they are expected to work individually in arriving at solutions. Electronically copying or cutting and pasting any section of another student's homework will be considered cheating and will lead to disciplinary action against both the copier and any student who made the electronic version available before the due date. Please do each problem on separate and stapled sheets with your name on it. Homework is normally due at the end of class on Wednesdays. Late homework will be accepted until 10 pm of the date it is due in a box outside one of the TAs' offices. 50% of the grade will be deducted from late homework unless there are extenuating circumstances that justify the late submission. Solutions to problem sets will be provided at 10 pm on the due date.</p> <h3 class=\"subsubhead\">Quizzes</h3> <p>Unannounced quizzes on the material presented in class or assigned for reading during the previous class.

It is like entering a large building with unlighted rooms, holding a dim flashlight and clutching a vague map that omits some of the stairways and passages. How best to learn one's way around? In these lessons we will attempt to move through a significant portion of the structure - say, half a textbook - in about two weeks. Then we will repeat the journey several times, each time inspecting the rooms more thoroughly. By this means we hope to gain, from the start, a sense of doing an entire process control job, as well as approach each new topic in the context of a familiar path.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Course Objectives</h2> <p>As a student, you will learn about:</p> <ul> <li>Systems that vary in time, with some tools for attacking the problems</li> <li>Single-loop feedback control of processes - concepts, terminology, methods, and performance</li> <li>Some ways to enhance feedback control</li> <li>Some of the hardware used in a control system</li> </ul> <p>I will show you:</p> <ul> <li>How to represent dynamic systems by equations and by transfer functions in block diagrams</li> <li>How to solve linear, constant-coefficient ODEs by Laplace transform and numerical methods</li> <li>How dynamic systems respond to disturbances, particularly pulse, step, and oscillatory</li> <li>How to calculate and use the frequency response of a system</li> <li>How to estimate the stability limits for a system, with or without control</li> <li>How to tune a single-loop controller for better response</li> <li>How to enhance feedback control with cascade, feedforward, and model-based structures</li> <li>An overview of sensors, valves, transducers, controllers - both hardware and performance considerations</li> </ul> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Prerequisites</h2> <p>The prerequisites for this course include <a href=\"/courses/mathematics/18-03-differential-equations-spring-2010\">Differential Equations (18.03)</a> and <a href=\"/courses/chemical-engineering/10-302-transport-processes-fall-2004\">Transport Processes (10.302)</a>.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Textbooks</h2> <p><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0070393621/ref=nosim/mitopencourse-20\"><img alt=\"Buy at Amazon\" align=\"absMiddle\" border=\"0\" src=\"/images/a_logo_17.gif\" /></a> Marlin, Thomas E. <em>Process Control.</em> 2nd ed.

The homework assignments familiarize students with ABACUSS simulations, batch processes, and separation systems. Students then develop a base case scenario as a first solution to the design problem. Students evaluate the economic feasibility of the base case solution. Through discussions with the instructors and TAs, students refine their model parameters to arrive at an optimized solution. Lastly, students communicate their solution by writing a report.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Prerequisites</h2> <p>The prerequisites for this course include 10.37, <a href=\"/courses/chemical-engineering/10-32-separation-processes-spring-2005\">10.32</a>, 10.301, 10.213 and <a href=\"/courses/chemistry/5-60-thermodynamics-kinetics-spring-2008/index.htm\">5.60</a>.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Meeting Hours</h2> <p>There is no formal restriction on which section you attend. The class will have three types of meeting: regular lectures, recitation sessions, and instructor office hours. Regular lectures will be held on campus and are indicated on the course schedule. Recitation sessions will also be held in the same room. No formal lecture material will be taught in recitation sessions; instead, students will be expected to bring questions and participate in a discussion of their design projects. Instructor office hour sessions will be held in the instructor's office. During these periods, the instructor's office will be open to any students with questions concerning their design projects.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Recommended Texts</h2> <p><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0070346127/ref=nosim/mitopencourse-20\"><img border=\"0\" align=\"absMiddle\" src=\"/images/a_logo_17.gif\" alt=\"Buy at Amazon\" /></a> King, C.

Of all our fossil fuel resources (coal, oil, gas), coal is by far the biggest. In the developed world, it is mostly used for electricity production, employing pulverized coal boilers and steam turbines. In the developing world, similar trends are seen, but coal still has significant usage in the industrial and domestic sectors. One consequence of burning carbon based fuels is the emission of carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) that in turn leads to global warming. While alternatives like solar, wind and biomass have some attractions, they do not, even with large scale expansion, have the potential to address the basic energy, fuel and chemical needs that are currently based on oil and gas. The problem for this class is to address the dilemma: how to burn fossil fuels without the associated environmental impacts?</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Course Description</h2> <p>This course introduces students to methods and background needed for conceptual design of continuously operating chemical plants. Particular attention is paid to the use of process modeling tools such as AspenPlusÂ® that are used in industry and to problems of current interest. Each student team is assigned to evaluate and design a different technology and prepare a final design report.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Prerequisites</h2> <p>This course is a senior design course and requires that a student has taken 10.490 Integrated Chemical Engineering I.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Textbooks</h2> <p>This course has no required text. Two references that you might find useful are:</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0070177627/ref=nosim/mitopencourse-20\"><img alt=\"Buy at Amazon\" src=\"/images/a_logo_17.gif\" align=\"absMiddle\" border=\"0\" /></a> Douglas, J. <em>Conceptual Design of Chemical Processes</em>.

ISBN: 9780471216636.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Organization</h2> <p>At the beginning of the term the course will meet for four 1-hour lectures per week. There are two class sessions one from 10-11 and another 11-12. The same material is covered in both classes. After three weeks the Friday class will be used for meetings of each student group and with the instructor. Occasionally classes will be held in the Department of Chemical Engineering Computer Laboratory. Laboratory sessions will begin on the second week of the term and continue until the end of the module.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Homework, Final Report, and Presentation</h2> <p>There will be approximately 6 homework sets during the beginning of the semester. The homework sets will be due approximately one week after being issued. We strongly encourage students to work in teams. The final solution must be your own work. Shortly after the beginning of the semester you will be formed into teams of four students to work on a design project. Each team will be assigned a different technology to develop/design/evaluate. Each team will write a design report and give a 30-minute presentation to the class and clients.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Policy For Academic Conduct</h2> <p>The homework, weekly summaries of progress and the final report have the primary function of helping you learn the material. The secondary function of these assignments is to aid the staff in assessing your understanding of the material, in particular when the time comes to provide a final grade for the course. To this end, the extent to which you collaborate with your colleagues in preparing this material must be understood and agreed upon by both the student team and the staff. The homework assignments are intended nearly exclusively to serve as a learning tool. As such, we are comfortable with collaboration amongst students on the solving of these assignments provided all collaborators are equal contributors to the solution of the problems. You must be prepared to defend your solutions in person if asked by the instructor.</p> <p>During the final semester of senior year you may be involved in job interviews, visits to graduate school and as a result you may not be able to attend all classes or have timing conflicts with homework and project meetings. Please make sure that the instructor is made aware in advance of these conflicts, particularly if there is likely be any delays in turning in homework or in meeting with your project team.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Grading Policy</h2> <p>The course grade is based on 200 points. Description of the activities can be found in <a href=\"/courses/chemical-engineering/10-491-integrated-chemical-engineering-ii-spring-2006/assignments\">assignments</a> and <a href=\"/courses/chemical-engineering/10-491-integrated-chemical-engineering-ii-spring-2006/projects\">projects</a>.</p> <p>The Design Report grade will be the same for all the group members. <strong>No late reports will be accepted</strong>.

Starting from a discussion of linear systems as the basic computational unit in scientific computing, methods for solving sets of nonlinear algebraic equations, ordinary differential equations, and differential-algebraic (DAE) systems are presented. Probability theory and its use in physical modeling is covered, as is the statistical analysis of data and parameter estimation. The finite difference and finite element techniques are presented for converting the partial differential equations obtained from transport phenomena to DAE systems. The use of these techniques will be demonstrated throughout the course in the MATLABÂ® computing environment.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Prerequisite</h2> <p>Solid undergraduate preparation including but not limited to Calculus (<a href=\"/courses/mathematics/18-01-single-variable-calculus-fall-2006/index.htm\">18.01</a>, <a href=\"/courses/mathematics/18-02-multivariable-calculus-spring-2006/index.htm\">18.02</a>), Differential Equations (<a href=\"/courses/mathematics/18-03-differential-equations-spring-2006/index.htm\">18.03</a>), Linear Algebra (<a href=\"/courses/mathematics/18-06-linear-algebra-spring-2005/index.htm\">18.06</a>), Thermodynamics (<a href=\"/courses/chemistry/5-60-thermodynamics-kinetics-spring-2008/index.htm\">5.60</a>, 10.213), Fluid Mechanics (10.301), Chemical Kinetics and Reactor Design (10.37).</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Texts</h2> <h3 class=\"subsubhead\">Required Text</h3> <p><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0521859719/ref=nosim/mitopencourse-20\"><img alt=\"Buy at Amazon\" src=\"/images/a_logo_17.gif\" align=\"absMiddle\" border=\"0\" /></a> Beers, Kenneth J. <em>Numerical Methods for Chemical Engineering: Applications in MATLABÂ®</em>.

The due date is 9am on Wednesday, although submissions after that time will be marked as late and (at least for this first homework) accepted on the same day. If you have difficulty working with the computer systems, please consult the TAs.</p> <p>Write a MicrosoftÂ® WordÂ® document with the title <em>username_HW1.doc</em>, where username is your MIT e-mail name (for example, for <em>sample_email_address_ihtfp@mit.edu</em>, it would be <em>sample_email_address_ihtfp_HW1.doc</em>). In this document, describe how you solved each problem, and include as figures any graphs that you wish to present. <strong>Like any piece of technical writing, you must find a balance between being concise and providing sufficient detail that an educated reader can follow your reasoning and methods.</strong> The MicrosoftÂ® equation editor is available for typing any equations.</p> <p>If in a particular problem you are asked to write a MATLABÂ® program, gather all necessary code into a single .m file and submit it electronically as well (we may wish to run it). Use the file name <em>username_HW1_PX.m</em> for the program for problem <em>X</em>. In your MicrosoftÂ® WordÂ® document, clearly note the name of any program that you submit, and describe how it may be used to perform the calculation for the problem; for example, describe what you should provide as input, how the results are stored, etc.</p> <p>Do all analysis and data visualization within your MATLABÂ® program - do not export your results to another program such as MicrosoftÂ® ExcelÂ® for plotting. It is not necessary and makes it difficult for us to reproduce (and assess) your results.</p> <p><strong>You are free to discuss and consult with your colleagues, but everyone must submit his or her own programs and solution. You may not simply copy the program of another, or jointly write the same program. This would defeat the purpose of the class, which is to provide you with personal experience in scientific computing.</strong></p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Grading</h2> <div class=\"maintabletemplate\"> <table class=\"tablewidth50\" summary=\"See table caption for summary.\"> <caption class=\"invisible\">Grading criteria.</caption> <thead align=\"left\"> <tr> <th scope=\"col\">ACTIVITIES</th> <th scope=\"col\">PERCENTAGES</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody align=\"left\"> <tr class=\"row\"> <td>Homework (best 10 out of 11 assignments)</td> <td>30%</td> </tr> <tr class=\"alt-row\"> <td>Two quizzes</td> <td>30%</td> </tr> <tr class=\"row\"> <td>Final exam</td> <td>40%</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> </div> <br /> <h2 class=\"subhead\"><a id=\"Calendar\" name=\"Calendar\"></a>Calendar</h2> <p>The calendar below provides information on the course's lecture (L) and quiz (Q) sessions.</p> <div class=\"maintabletemplate\"> <table class=\"tablewidth75\" summary=\"See table caption for summary.\"> <caption class=\"invisible\">Course calendar.</caption> <thead align=\"left\"> <tr> <th scope=\"col\">SES #</th> <th scope=\"col\">TOPICS</th> <th scope=\"col\">KEY DATES</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody align=\"left\"> <tr class=\"row\"> <td>L1</td> <td>Using MATLABÂ® to evaluate and plot expressions</td> <td></td> </tr> <tr class=\"alt-row\"> <td>L2</td> <td>Solving systems of linear equations</td> <td></td> </tr> <tr class=\"row\"> <td>L3</td> <td> <p>Matrix factorization</p> <p>Modularization</p> </td> <td></td> </tr> <tr class=\"alt-row\"> <td>L4</td> <td>When algorithms run into problems: Numerical error, ill-conditioning, and tolerances</td> <td>Problem set 1 due: MATLABÂ®</td> </tr> <tr class=\"row\"> <td>L5</td> <td>Introduction to systems of nonlinear equations</td> <td></td> </tr> <tr class=\"alt-row\"> <td>L6</td> <td>Modern methods for solving nonlinear equations</td> <td></td> </tr> <tr class=\"row\"> <td>L7</td> <td>Introduction to eigenvalues and eigenvectors</td> <td>Problem set 2 due: Systems of equations</td> </tr> <tr class=\"alt-row\"> <td>L8</td> <td>Constructing and using the eigenvector basis</td> <td></td> </tr> <tr class=\"row\"> <td>L9</td> <td>Function space vs. real space methods for partial differential equations (PDEs)</td> <td>Problem set 3 due: Eigenvalues, linear algebra</td> </tr> <tr class=\"alt-row\"> <td>L10</td> <td>Function space</td> <td></td> </tr> <tr class=\"row\"> <td>L11</td> <td> <p>Numerical calculation of eigenvalues and eigenvectors</p> <p>Singular value decomposition (SVD)</p> </td> <td>Problem set 4 due: Eigenvectors</td> </tr> <tr class=\"alt-row\"> <td>Q1</td> <td>Quiz 1</td> <td></td> </tr> <tr class=\"row\"> <td>L12</td> <td>Ordinary differential equation -

This class presents the most common synthetic methods used in polymerization, the basic differences in the kinetics of these methods, the final end-products obtained, and the synthetic processing techniques that might be used for various applications.</p> <p>New and developing approaches to polymerization such as atom transfer free radical and &quot;living&quot; free radical methods are addressed using literature references and class discussion. Throughout the course, general materials and engineering design concepts are introduced, as well as the manipulation of polymer structure and processing to obtain desired properties. In the class, we emphasize the use of chemistry as a tool for the development of new materials or the modification of existing polymer systems. For this reason, the course covers functionalization of polymers, including polymer surface modification for applications requiring improved adhesive, frictional, or reactive properties. The use of self-assembly in the formation of macromolecular structures using hydrogen bonding, ionic bonding, and other non-covalent bonds is discussed at the end of the course by means of examples from the literature and classroom discussion. A design project is introduced at the middle of the term as a means of engaging students in their own research interests.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Prerequisites</h2> <p>This course assumes knowledge of organic chemistry (<a href=\"/courses/chemistry/5-12-organic-chemistry-i-spring-2005/index.htm\">5.12</a> and <a href=\"/courses/chemistry/5-13-organic-chemistry-ii-fall-2003/index.htm\">5.13</a>) and thermodynamics and kinetics (<a href=\"/courses/chemistry/5-60-thermodynamics-kinetics-spring-2008/index.htm\">5.60</a>).</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Texts</h2> <p><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0471274003/ref=nosim/mitopencourse-20\"><img alt=\"Buy at Amazon\" align=\"absMiddle\" border=\"0\" src=\"/images/a_logo_17.gif\" /></a> Odian, George. <em>Principles of Polymerization</em>. 4th ed.

You will be introduced to and become familiar with all relevant physical properties and fundamental laws governing the behavior of materials and structures and you will learn how to solve a variety of problems of interest to civil and environmental engineers. While there will be a chance for you to put your mathematical skills obtained in 18.01, 18.02, and eventually 18.03 to use in this subject, the emphasis is on the physical understanding of why a material or structure behaves the way it does in the engineering design of materials and structures.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Lectures</h2> <p>Detailed lecture notes will be distributed for each lecture, usually covering &quot;theoretical&quot; aspects (derivations, etc.) in more detail or in a different manner than done during class. The subject content is defined by the material presented in lectures, recitations and reading assignments, so regular attendance is advisable.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Recitations</h2> <p>Recitations will illustrate and/or expand concepts presented in lectures by working through example problems or conducting simple experiments. Material covered in recitations is often related to homework assignments and is considered part of the subject content, so regular attendance at one of the two weekly recitations is advisable.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Lecture Summary Slide</h2> <p>After each lecture we will distribute a single summary slide. The goal of these summary slides is to convey the most important message(s) of each lecture - these should help you to review the lecture notes and prepare for quizzes and exams. The slide is not a complete summary of the contents; you should rather see it as a skeleton to guide your review of the lecture material.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Content Survey</h2> <p>At the end of each lecture, the TA will collect a brief survey in which you are asked to indicate how much of the material you understand. The survey will consist of a series of questions, for each of which you are asked to indicate if you'd be able to answer it (yes/no). This will provide us with immediate feedback about the understanding of the lecture material and will enable the instructor to react to potential difficulties or to emphasize on certain points more clearly.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Lecture Notes</h2> <p>We have developed detailed lecture notes for 1.050, which are used as the sole required reading for the subject. Some further reading references are given at the end of each chapter in the lecture notes, which may be of interest to you, but which are not required reading.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Homework</h2> <p>Problem sets will be distributed each Wednesday and are due on Wednesday the week after. Each problem set is designed to build upon the material covered in the preceding lectures and recitations. Homework assignments will be prepared by teams consisting of three students. Each team will hand in one solution, with the names of team members who contributed indicated on the cover page. Due dates for problem sets are firm and homework assignments will be corrected and handed back (with solutions) no later than two lectures after the due date.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Exams</h2> <p>There will be two in-class hour exams, on 2 days after Ses #16 and 3 days after Ses #28. There will also be a three-hour scheduled final exam.

The first two tasks require the design, fabrication and testing of hardware. Several laboratory experiments will be carried out and lectures will be presented to introduce students to the conceptual and experimental basis for design in both domains.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Course Conduct</h2> <p>All students are expected to attend the Tuesday lectures. The class will be split into two sections, A and B, for the laboratory work. Section A will meet on Wednesday afternoon, B on Thursday afternoon.</p> <p>Students will work in groups of from 3 to 5 on all laboratory tasks. Groups will be defined by the faculty in charge but with an ear open to requests for specific partners. Group composition will vary from one task to the next.</p> <p>The most successful experiments in science and engineering are those in which you know what the outcome will be before you start. Indeed, you cannot design an experiment without knowing something about the range of possible value of variables and parameters, a safe loading of the structure, an instruments sensitivity to some external disturbance, and the like. So procedures for each experiment are to be read before the start of lab even though these can only sketch out what needs to be done to effect a measurement. Certain constraints are printed in bold within these descriptions. These constraints are to be strictly observed. In part this is for safety reasons, in part because we do not want to break something that is not supposed to be broken, overload an instrument, or flood the basement. If you are not sure, ask your lab instructor.</p> <p>Each lab session will begin with an orientation. The faculty in charge will respond to questions and convey essential, often tacit, knowledge regarding the smooth conduct of the experiment or ways to carry through a design/fabrication/testing task. The lab instructor, TA, and technical instructor will be available throughout the lab session to provoke your thinking in response to questions that you pose.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Course Requirements</h2> <p>You are required to keep a lab notebook. You are to use ink, make no erasures. Draw a line through that text which you find faulty or erroneous. Sketches of apparatus may be made in pencil. Make sure you record all relevant dimensions (don't neglect to record the units), variables, settings, materials, and information that will enable you to write the report without coming back to the lab to check up on the value of a critical parameter. Reserve a section of your lab notebook for documenting your design tasks.</p> <p>While we will periodically review your notebooks, these are primarily for your reading, not ours. They should provide you with a record to draw upon in writing up the reports which <strong>are</strong> primarily for our reading and evaluation.</p> <p>You will prepare, <strong>as individuals</strong>, a one to two page report on <strong>each experiment done in the lab</strong>. Ordinarily you will have time to complete this report and hand in before the end of the lab session. Details about the content and format of these will be prescribed at the start of the lab.</p> <p>You will prepare and submit, <strong>as a group</strong>, a report <strong>on each of the three design tasks</strong>. Details, again, will be defined at the introduction to the design task.</p> <p>Written reports will be judged on their clarity and legibility as well as their technical content. Reports are to be submitted as hard copy unless otherwise indicated. The use of appropriate software applications is encouraged if such use promotes clarity and legibility.</p> <p>Groups will be called upon to describe and review their design efforts to the class as a whole at the times noted on the syllabus.</p> <p>Individually, you are required to develop materials, abstracted from each of your three design reports, for a portfolio.</p> <p>There will be occasional, short reading assignments.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Safety</h2> <p>Attention to safety is absolutely required of all participants. Key elements of shop safety include knowledge of proper machine operation, full attention to the task, and use of protective equipment. Proper shop housekeeping, including maintaining an organized workspace and cleaning up after yourself, is essential. See and comply with the <strong>Safety Instructions</strong> as well as instructor directions (you will be asked to acknowledge that you have received and read this document). Any person deemed to be working in a manner that presents a hazard to themselves or others may be removed from the course at the discretion of the instructors.</p> <p>Tools and supplies: Kits of hand tools will be signed out to each team, which will be responsible for their security and their return. Supplies will also be provided for prototyping. Students who wish to use tools and materials other than those supplied should speak with an instructor first.</p> <p>CEE Shop Protocol (<a href=\"/courses/civil-and-environmental-engineering/1-101-introduction-to-civil-and-environmental-engineering-design-i-fall-2006/syllabus/shop_protocol.pdf\">PDF</a>)</p> <p>Hand and Power Tool Safety (<a href=\"/courses/civil-and-environmental-engineering/1-101-introduction-to-civil-and-environmental-engineering-design-i-fall-2006/syllabus/tool_safety.pdf\">PDF</a>)</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Grading</h2> <p>Grades will be based both on participation and on the design and laboratory reports.

Additional materials, updated as needed by Professor de Neufville, can be found there.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Important Notes</h2> <ul> <li>This course emphasizes the development of &quot;application portfolios&quot;. These assignments show how the course material applies to each student's own professional interests (see the <a href=\"/courses/engineering-systems-division/esd-71-engineering-systems-analysis-for-design-fall-2008/assignments\">assignments</a> section). Students have routinely incorporated these applications in their research, thesis, and professional presentations.</li> <li>The subject assumes that participants are competent in the material covered by ESD.70J, the 3-unit micro-subject that covers Excel spreadsheet analyses. Go to that site for a self-assessment of whether you need to audit that subject (experience indicates you probably do).</li> </ul> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Organization of Subject</h2> <p>This subject focuses on the flexible design of engineering systems. It recognizes that the future is necessarily uncertain, and that we need to deliver good value for the range of possible scenarios. Flexible designs enable system operators to adapt their project to future circumstances, to avoid downside risks and to take advantage of upside opportunities.</p> <p>Many researchers and practitioners believe that flexible design will revolutionize the way we develop and manage complex projects. Indeed, case studies indicate that the approach can improve expected performance by around 25 percent. These are significant opportunities.</p> <p>The course shows how design flexibility can substantially increase the expected value of a system. It presents an integrated approach that</p> <ul> <li>properly deals with evaluation over time in risky situations, and</li> <li>pinpoints the value of specific design elements.</li> </ul> <p>The course consists of 3 major blocks.</p> <h3 class=\"subsubhead\">Basics: Recognition of Uncertainty, Valuation Fundamentals, and Timing Issues</h3> <p>This introductory block establishes three fundamental issues and provides the economic motivation for flexibility in design:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Recognition of Uncertainty</strong> is the crucial starting point. The understanding that the future is uncertain and that we must design our systems to operate in many possible scenarios provides the motivation for making our systems adaptable, for building flexibility into them.</li> <li><strong>Valuation Fundamentals</strong> covers the main analytic and conceptual issues associated with the valuation long-term projects. Here, the primary concern is with the relative value of the projects over time.</li> <li><strong>Timing Issues</strong> discusses the design issues â principally economies of scale and learning curves â that affect the tradeoff between building larger projects initially versus developing systems incrementally over time.</li> </ul> <h3 class=\"subsubhead\">Uncertainty Modeling and Flexibility Valuation Methods</h3> <p>This is the core analytic section of the course. It presents Decision Analysis and Lattice Analysis as the two means to assess the value of flexibility in design. Both provide ways to think through the many ways in which scenarios will occur over time, and correspondingly how system developers can react effectively to these alternate futures. Decision Analysis makes is possible to look at more complex futures, while Lattice Analysis is computationally much more efficient. Analysts need to understand the relative merits of each approach and which to use when, either singly or in combination.</p> <p>This section builds upon the Monte Carlo simulation methods presented in the Excel mini-course (ESD.70J) given at the start of the semester.</p> <h3 class=\"subsubhead\">Flexibility Identification Methods &quot;in&quot; Systems</h3> <p>This section explores the question of how designers can identify the parts of the system that should be flexible. The issue is that any significant system could be flexible in many, many different ways and it is important to identify which elements might most effectively contribute to increasing the expected value of the overall system. This is a primary area of current research, and the course will showcase current and recent doctoral research and other projects at the forefront of the field.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Prerequisites</h2> <p>This subject builds upon a basic knowledge of calculus and probability.</p> <p>Students should be proficient in the use of spreadsheet programs at the level covered by ESD.70J, the 3-unit intensive short course designed to bring them up to speed in Excel. In general, everyone will benefit from participating in this offering.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Course Materials</h2> <p>The primary text for the class consists of draft chapters from the new text being written for the MIT Press. Prof. de Neufville will distribute these electronically throughout the semester.</p> <p>This material is supplemented by chapters from:</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0070163723/ref=nosim/mitopencourse-20\"><img align=\"absMiddle\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Buy at Amazon\" src=\"/images/a_logo_17.gif\" /></a> de Neufville, Richard. <em>Applied Systems Analysis</em>. New York, NY: McGraw-Hill, 1990. ISBN: 9780070163720.</p> <p>Extensive references and papers are available from the <a href=\"http://ardent.mit.edu/real_options/ROcse_MIT_latest/index.html\">course Web site</a>.</p> <p>All students will be expected to have an up-to-date full version of Excel. They may also want to try the following optional add-ins:</p> <p><strong>TreeAge Pro</strong> can be downloaded for a 21-day trial from: <a href=\"http://treeage-pro.software.informer.com/6.0/\">TreeAge Pro Trial Version Download</a>, and student licenses can be obtained from: <a href=\"https://www.treeage.com/shop/\">The TreeAge Software Store</a>.</p> <p><strong>Crystal Ball</strong> information is available here: <a href=\"http://www.oracle.com/industries/education/oracle-crystal-ball-classroom-edition.html\">Oracle Crystal Ball Classroom Edition</a>.</p> <p>Participants can view and download PDF copies of the PowerPoint slides on the course Web site. As the instructors routinely improve their presentations as the class proceeds, the Web versions of the slides change from time to time. Students may wish to verify that they have the latest version before downloading the slides for reference in class.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Recitations</h2> <p>There will be regular weekly problem-solving sessions. Prof. de Neufville will schedule these in consultation with the class during the opening session.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Assignments</h2> <p>The graded assignments for the class mainly involve the &quot;application portfolio&quot;. This is a collection of applications, on topics individually selected by each student, using the methods presented in class on an issue. This has two phases:</p> <ul> <li>Individual assignments throughout the semester.</li> <li>A final portfolio that builds upon the individual assignments and the feedback during the semester. It will present an integrated whole so that each student will each have a completed case study demonstrating how they can use design flexibility to increase the expected value of their systems.</li> </ul> <p>Ungraded problems drawn from the <em>Applied Systems Analysis</em> text are distributed throughout the semester. Students are advised to complete them as a way of insuring that they know how to complete the applications â and pass the tests! Solutions to these problems will be posted so that students can grade themselves and get immediate feedback.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Grading</h2> <p>Grades depend principally on the application portfolio and tests, but include an allowance for class participation. The approximate weights are:</p> <div class=\"maintabletemplate\"><table class=\"tablewidth50\" summary=\"See table caption for summary.\"> <caption class=\"invisible\">Grading criteria.</caption> <thead align=\"left\"> <tr> <th scope=\"col\">ACTIVITIES</th> <th scope=\"col\">PERCENTAGES</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody align=\"left\"> <tr class=\"row\"> <td>Individual and final application portfolio</td> <td>40%</td> </tr> <tr class=\"alt-row\"> <td>Class participation and graded assignments</td> <td>15%</td> </tr> <tr class=\"row\"> <td>Mid-semester quiz</td> <td>20%</td> </tr> <tr class=\"alt-row\"> <td>Final examination</td> <td>25%</td> </tr> </tbody> </table></div> <p> </p> <p>Students should complete assignments on time. The teaching assistant will mark down unexcused late assignments.</p> <p>The instructors will modulate the final grade in appreciation of the participant's progress throughout the semester. Those who finish strongly and demonstrate that they have, at the end, mastered the material will receive more credit for the final grades.</p> <p>Previous quizzes and exams are posted in the &quot;Exercises&quot; section of the Web page. They indicate the kind of questions likely to appear on future exams. However, their content may not match the current syllabus, which is evolving along with research advances.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Academic Honesty</h2> <p>To avoid confusion that might result from different expectations in other contexts or establishments, please note the standards that apply in this subject:</p> <ul> <li>Assignments turned in for grading must be done individually. The instructors understand that students will discuss the course and often learn best collectively. However, students should prepare their reports for each assignment individually, in their own format and words.</li> <li>Demonstrated evidence of copying (exactly the same presentation, same wording of sentences, etc.) will result in zeros for each paper with this evidence.</li> <li>Anyone found cheating in an examination (copying from another student or using unauthorized materials, etc.) will receive a zero for the event.</li> <li>Material copied from other sources (articles, reports, Web pages, etc) must be properly cited. Evidence that material has been taken from elsewhere without citation will be treated as plagiarism.</li> <li>Prof. de Neufville will place a note in the student record of each person associated with plagiarism or cheating. MIT views these infractions seriously and routinely expels students who seriously violate our academic standards.</li> </ul> <p>Any questions about this policy should be addressed to the instructors.</p> <div class=\"help slide-bottom\"> <div class=\"help-message\"> <a class=\"help-engage\" href=\"javascript: trackEvents('Bottom Get Started','bottom get started Click','Help Overlay');\">Need help getting started?</a> <a href=\"javascript:disableHelpPopup(); trackEvents('Bottom Don\\'t Show','bottom don\\'t show Click','Help Overlay');\" class=\"help-dismiss\">Don't show me this again</a> </div> </div> <div class=\"help popup-center\"> <div class=\"help-message\"> <p class=\"help-dismiss\"><a href=\"javascript:disableHelpPopup(); trackEvents('Popup Don\\'t Show','popup don\\'t show Click','Help Overlay');\">Don't show me this again</a></p> <h2>Welcome!</h2> <p>This is one of over 2,200 courses on OCW.

Both aim at introducing students to quantitative uncertainty analysis and risk assessment for engineering applications. The subjects cover similar material, but the 1.151, the graduate version, includes additional topics (such as system reliability) and is faster-paced and more in-depth. The undergraduate course includes weekly recitations mainly to solve problems, review material presented in class, and engage students in bi-weekly 30-minute mini-quizzes. Along with these small quizzes, there is a final exam.</p> <p>Both subjects try to strike a balance between mathematical rigor and applications. No previous familiarity with probability or statistics is assumed. However, students should be conversant with basic linear algebra (vectors and matrices) and calculus (derivatives, and integrals).</p> <p>Emphasis is on probability theory and its applications, with a smaller module at the end covering basic topics in statistics (parameter estimation, hypothesis testing and regression analysis). The probability part includes events and their probability, the Total Probability and Bayes' Theorems, discrete and continuous random variables and vectors, the Bernoulli trial sequence and Poisson process models, conditional distributions, functions of random variables and vectors, statistical moments, second-moment uncertainty propagation and second-moment conditional analysis, and various probability models such as the exponential, gamma, normal, lognormal, uniform, beta and extreme-type distributions. In addition, the graduate subject has a module on system reliability, which covers both second-moment and full-distribution techniques. Throughout the subjects, emphasis is on application to engineering and everyday life problems.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Recommended Text</h2> <p>The recommended text for this class is:</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/047103200X/ref=nosim/mitopencourse-20\"><img border=\"0\" alt=\"Buy at Amazon\" align=\"absMiddle\" src=\"/images/a_logo_17.gif\" /></a> Ang, Alfredo, and Wilson Tang. <em>Probability Concepts in Engineering Planning and Design: Vol I - Basic Principles</em>.

Safety relates to extreme loadings which are likely to occur no more than once during a structure's life and is concerned with the collapse of the structure, major damage to the structure and its contents, and loss of life. Serviceability pertains to moderate loadings which may occur several times during the structure's lifetime. For service loadings, the structure should remain operational, i.e. the structure should suffer minimal damage, and furthermore, the motion experienced by the structure should not exceed specified comfort limits for humans and motion sensitive equipment mounted on the structure.</p> <p>Safety concerns are satisfied by requiring the resistance (i.e. strength) of the individual structural elements to be greater than the demand associated with the extreme loading. Once the structure is proportioned, the stiffness properties are derived and used to check the various serviceability constraints such as elastic behavior. Iteration is usually necessary for convergence to an acceptable structural design. This approach is referred to as strength based design since the elements are proportioned initially according to strength requirements.</p> <p>Applying a strength based approach for preliminary design is appropriate when strength is the dominant design requirement. In the past, most structural design problems have fallen in this category. However, the following developments have occurred recently which have limited the effectiveness of the strength based approach. Firstly, the trend toward more flexible structures such as tall buildings and longer span horizontal structures has resulted in more structural motion under service loading, thus shifting the emphasis from safety toward serviceability. Secondly, some of the new types of facilities such as space platforms and semi-conductor manufacturing centers have more severe design constraints on motion than the typical civil structure. For example, in the case of silicon chip manufacturing, the environment has to be essentially motion free. Thirdly, recent advances in material science and engineering have resulted in significant increases in the strength of traditional civil engineering materials. However, the material stiffness has not increased at the same rate. The lag in material stiffness versus material strength has led to a problem with satisfying the requirements on the various motion parameters. Indeed, for very high strength materials, the motion requirements control the design. Fourthly, experience with recent earthquakes has shown that the cost of repairing structural damage due to inelastic deformation was considerably greater than anticipated. This finding has resulted in a trend toward decreasing the reliance on inelastic deformation and controlling the structural response with other types of energy dissipation and absorption mechanisms.</p> <p>Motion based structural design is an alternate design paradigm which addresses these issues. The approach takes as its primary objective the satisfaction of motion related design requirements such as restrictions on displacement and acceleration, and seeks the optimal deployment of material stiffness and motion control devices to achieve these design targets as well as satisfy the constraints on strength. Structural motion control is the enabling technology for motion based design.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Course Textbook</h2> <p>Connor, J. J. <em>Introduction to Structural Motion Control.</em> Prentice Hall, August 2002.</p> <p>This book provides a systematic treatment of the basic concepts and computational procedures for structural motion control. Examples illustrating the application of motion control to a wide spectrum of buildings are also presented. Topics covered include optimal stiffness distributions for building type structures, the role of damping in controlling motion, tuned mass dampers, base isolation systems, quasi-static active control, dynamic feedback control, and neural network based control systems. The targeted audience is practicing engineers and graduate students.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Grading</h2> <p>Grading is based on 13 problems sets and 2 exams.</p> <div class=\"help slide-bottom\"> <div class=\"help-message\"> <a class=\"help-engage\" href=\"javascript: trackEvents('Bottom Get Started','bottom get started Click','Help Overlay');\">Need help getting started?</a> <a href=\"javascript:disableHelpPopup(); trackEvents('Bottom Don\\'t Show','bottom don\\'t show Click','Help Overlay');\" class=\"help-dismiss\">Don't show me this again</a> </div> </div> <div class=\"help popup-center\"> <div class=\"help-message\"> <p class=\"help-dismiss\"><a href=\"javascript:disableHelpPopup(); trackEvents('Popup Don\\'t Show','popup don\\'t show Click','Help Overlay');\">Don't show me this again</a></p> <h2>Welcome!</h2> <p>This is one of over 2,200 courses on OCW.

Topics covered include the design and management of facilities for river basin development, flood control, water supply, groundwater remediation, and other activities related to water resources. Simulation models and optimization methods are often used to support analyses of water resource problems. In this subject we will be constructing simulation models with the <a href=\"http://www.mathworks.com/support/\">MATLABÂ® programming language</a> and solving numerical optimization problems with the <a href=\"http://www.gams.com/\">GAMS optimization package</a>. It is desirable for students taking this subject to have some background in hydrology, linear algebra and programming, although these are not strict prerequisites.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Grading</h2> <p>There will be an in-class midterm exam and an in-class final exam. There will also be a class project which will be carried out during the second half of the semester. Homework will be designed to build skills. The grade will be based on exams, project, and homework.

These provide a valuable real-world experience to complement the extensive coursework students receive.</p> <p>1.782 is the project subject for students in the Environmental track of the MEng program. Analogous subjects for the High Performance Structures (HPS) and Information Technology tracks are 1.562 and 1.120, respectively. Students in the Geotechnical track usually join with students in the HPS or Environmental tracks for their project.</p> <p>The project / thesis is a yearlong effort designed to mimic professional practice. In September, participating faculty and staff present a number of potential projects and a mock &quot;request for proposal&quot; (RFP) is provided for each. The goal is to offer sufficient choices that students are able to choose a project within their specialty. Students respond to the RFP by forming &quot;companies,&quot; or units within companies, usually of 3-5 students each. The process begins with a written &quot;letter of intent&quot; submitted in early October. In November teams submit a draft proposal and present it orally to their companies' &quot;upper management,&quot; consisting of project supervisors who critique the proposed work plan. In December they present their final proposal (in written and oral forms) to their &quot;client&quot; (a mock government agency or large engineering firm). These final proposal presentations are tape-recorded and students are asked to critique their own presentationâand that of a classmateâas an assignment in their Concepts of Engineering Practice subject (1.133). During January, when there are few formal classes, students work intensively on their project, usually visiting their project site. Final oral presentations are made to the public in April, and students spend their last month finishing their individual theses, which are developed from the group project. The final project report, due along with the theses in May, can either be an integration of the individual theses or a condensed exposition suitable for publication in a journal or conference proceeding.</p> <p>Recent 1.782 projects include the MMR Superfund site on Cape Cod, appropriate wastewater treatment technology for Brazil and Honduras, point-of-use water treatment and safe storage procedures for Nepal and Ghana, Brownfields Development in Providence, RI, and water resource planning for the island of Cyprus and refugee settlements in Thailand.</p> <p>Representative RFPs, proposal presentations, and final presentations are presented on this site.</p> <div class=\"help slide-bottom\"> <div class=\"help-message\"> <a class=\"help-engage\" href=\"javascript: trackEvents('Bottom Get Started','bottom get started Click','Help Overlay');\">Need help getting started?</a> <a href=\"javascript:disableHelpPopup(); trackEvents('Bottom Don\\'t Show','bottom don\\'t show Click','Help Overlay');\" class=\"help-dismiss\">Don't show me this again</a> </div> </div> <div class=\"help popup-center\"> <div class=\"help-message\"> <p class=\"help-dismiss\"><a href=\"javascript:disableHelpPopup(); trackEvents('Popup Don\\'t Show','popup don\\'t show Click','Help Overlay');\">Don't show me this again</a></p> <h2>Welcome!</h2> <p>This is one of over 2,200 courses on OCW.

Student participation (comments, questions, discussion, etc.) is essential for this teaching method to be successful. Note that you will be expected to have done the reading, and part of your grade (Â±3%) will depend on class participation and preparation.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Problem Sets</h2> <p>Problem sets will be due in class approximately every week and will be graded and returned within one or two class meetings. The main intent of the homework is as a teaching tool. Some collaboration among students can be useful in facilitating this goal. We consider the following approach appropriate. First, spend a reasonable amount of time on your own attempting the problem set. Then, feel free to discuss approaches with your fellow students or come to us with questions.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Exams</h2> <p>There will be two one-hour exams. The first will be a mid-term to be taken in class, on mid-term exam. The second will be held during final exam week as a scheduled final, but will be approximately one hour in length. It will be accorded the same weight in grading as the midterm exam. Crib notes for midterm: one page (two sides of an 8.5x11&quot; page). For &quot;final&quot; you may use crib notes from midterm plus one additional page.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Paper</h2> <p>A five page paper will be due near the end of the term, on Lec #35. A significant portion of the paper grade will be based on the paper outline (due approximately 4 weeks before the final draft) and rough draft (due approximately 2 weeks before the final draft). See handout for paper guidelines and additional information.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Presentation</h2> <p>Students will present five-minute presentations on their term-paper topics on the last two days of class in the term.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Grading</h2> <p>The course grade will be an average of the following:</p> <div class=\"maintabletemplate\"><table class=\"tablewidth50\" summary=\"See table caption for summary.\"> <caption class=\"invisible\">Grading criteria.</caption> <thead align=\"left\"> <tr> <th scope=\"col\">ACTIVITIES</th> <th scope=\"col\">PERCENTAGES</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody align=\"left\"> <tr class=\"row\"> <td>Problem sets</td> <td>40%</td> </tr> <tr class=\"alt-row\"> <td>Paper and presentation</td> <td>20%</td> </tr> <tr class=\"row\"> <td>Midterm</td> <td>20%</td> </tr> <tr class=\"alt-row\"> <td>Final</td> <td>20%</td> </tr> <tr class=\"row\"> <td>In-class contributions and discussion</td> <td>Â±3%</td> </tr> </tbody> </table></div> <div class=\"help slide-bottom\"> <div class=\"help-message\"> <a class=\"help-engage\" href=\"javascript: trackEvents('Bottom Get Started','bottom get started Click','Help Overlay');\">Need help getting started?</a> <a href=\"javascript:disableHelpPopup(); trackEvents('Bottom Don\\'t Show','bottom don\\'t show Click','Help Overlay');\" class=\"help-dismiss\">Don't show me this again</a> </div> </div> <div class=\"help popup-center\"> <div class=\"help-message\"> <p class=\"help-dismiss\"><a href=\"javascript:disableHelpPopup(); trackEvents('Popup Don\\'t Show','popup don\\'t show Click','Help Overlay');\">Don't show me this again</a></p> <h2>Welcome!</h2> <p>This is one of over 2,200 courses on OCW.

Through focused lectures, students are instructed in the fundamentals of the ocean environment, chemical sampling and analysis, and measurement and instrumentation. They apply these techniques in the field and the laboratory; through the semester, students also fabricate and test a specialized sensor and data logger. Written and oral reports are required of the students.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Subject Overview</h2> <p>There are three main elements to the course: Oceanic Chemical Sampling and Analysis, Instrumentation Development for the Ocean Environment, and the Larger Field of Ocean Science.</p> <h3 class=\"subsubhead\">Chemical Sampling and Analysis</h3> <p>The subject begins with a day trip to Boston Harbor and Buzzards Bay aboard the WHOI coastal research vessel, the R/V Tioga. During this field trip, we will be collecting a series of water samples for analysis during this course. We will teach you some of the basic measurements that are standard for environmental analysis, including nutrient analyses and contaminant analyses. You will conduct each measurement on a subset of Boston Harbor samples and will be taught how to interpret the data. You will examine all the data collected by you and your classmates; each student will present a subset of the data and interpret it in the context of other data collected by the class. At the end of the course, you will have generated a chemical and physical snapshot of Boston Harbor and its surroundings.</p> <h3 class=\"subsubhead\">Instrumentation</h3> <p>Early in the subject, you are introduced to a data logging micro-processor and a water-depth sensor which will be used to measure tidal range off Woods Hole. We provide the necessary background to understand and implement the sensor. A portion of the available laboratory time in the subject is devoted to your building and testing the device - it will be field tested twice during your stay in Woods Hole.</p> <h3 class=\"subsubhead\">Ocean Science</h3> <p>The goal is for students taking the course to gain an appreciation for how science is done in the ocean, and why. Drawing on current problems in the field, such as deep ocean circulation, carbon cycles, erosion, global warming, and energy, we will discuss throughout the semester how science can be applied to understand issues and support rational decisions.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Instructors</h2> <p>Dr. Elizabeth Kujawinski, Assistant Scientist, Dept of Marine Chemistry and Geochemistry, WHOI<br /> Dr. Sheri White, Assistant Scientist, Dept of Applied Ocean Physics and Engineering, WHOI<br /> Dr. Franz Hover, Principal Research Engineer, Dept of Mechanical Engineering, MIT</p> <p>The course is sponsored by the MIT Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences, the MIT Center for Ocean Engineering and the WHOI Academic Programs Office.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Required Materials</h2> <p>Composition notebook with lines - this notebook must be brought to each lab session.<br /> 3-ring binder for all laboratory handouts.<br /> Laptop computer (optional).</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Grading</h2> <p>The course is P/F. Students will be evaluated based on completion of the assigned laboratory work, data reduction and analysis from laboratory exercises, and a final report / presentation on the students' sampling device.</p> <div class=\"help slide-bottom\"> <div class=\"help-message\"> <a class=\"help-engage\" href=\"javascript: trackEvents('Bottom Get Started','bottom get started Click','Help Overlay');\">Need help getting started?</a> <a href=\"javascript:disableHelpPopup(); trackEvents('Bottom Don\\'t Show','bottom don\\'t show Click','Help Overlay');\" class=\"help-dismiss\">Don't show me this again</a> </div> </div> <div class=\"help popup-center\"> <div class=\"help-message\"> <p class=\"help-dismiss\"><a href=\"javascript:disableHelpPopup(); trackEvents('Popup Don\\'t Show','popup don\\'t show Click','Help Overlay');\">Don't show me this again</a></p> <h2>Welcome!</h2> <p>This is one of over 2,200 courses on OCW.

It discusses recognition, interpretation, and mechanics of faults, folds, structural features of igneous and metamorphic rocks, and superposed deformations and introduces regional structural geology and tectonics. Laboratory includes techniques of structural analysis, recognition and interpretation of structures on geologic maps, and construction of interpretive cross sections.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Prerequisites</h2> <p>Introduction to Geology (12.001), Applications of Continuum Mechanics to Earth, Atmospheric, and Planetary Sciences (12.005)</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Required Text</h2> <p>Twiss, Robert J., and Eldridge M. Moores. <em>Structural Geology</em>. New York, NY: W. H. Freeman, 1992. ISBN: 9780716722526.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Lab Information</h2> <p>&quot;Labs&quot; for this course serve two main purposes: first, they are a chance to discuss material covered during the week, answer questions, and supplement the lecture materials; second, they consist of exercises that apply material covered in lecture and reading to various problems.</p> <p>There are 10 lab assignments. Apart from a few labs that will focus on specific techniques of structural geology (3D geometry, stereonets, Mohr circles), the labs will be based on geological maps and real data. If you are taking 12.114 (Field Geology), the experience you gain in this course will serve you well as you put theory into practice out in the mountains.</p> <p>Labs will meet for 3 hours per week. At the beginning of each class, you will be given a mini-quiz. This will take 10 minutes, and we will correct them immediately. The mini quizzes will cover material from the lectures and ensure that everyone is more or less on the same page before beginning that week's lab assignment. Then we will begin to work on the practical exercises for that week.</p> <p>Ideally, most of the work will be done in-class. You may have to spend some time outside of class ensuring that you hand in clear and well-presented material. Group work is encouraged during lab meeting times, but you are responsible for the work you hand in.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Lab Grading</h2> <p>Labs make up 25% of your grade, but you must pass the lab portion of the course to earn credit for the course, i.e. No matter how well you do on the midterm and final exam, you still need to pass the lab. Lab assignments are due at the beginning of the next weeks lab. The week after that (one week after you turn them in) we will return old labs and hand out the answer key. Late assignments will be docked 10% each day after the due date. I will not accept assignments more than one week overdue. Extension may be given in exceptional circumstances, but you need to clear it with me as early as possible.</p> <p>Labs will be graded according to clarity of expression, grammar, and good scientific style. Just writing down &quot;the right answer&quot; is usually only enough for a barely passing grade. (Note that since most of the questions will be worked on in class time, you will, in most cases, already be armed with the answers. Your work will consist of thoughtfully articulating these results.)</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Lab Materials</h2> <p>You will want to have the following materials on hand:</p> <ul> <li>Pencil(s) - thin (0.5 or 0.3 mm lead) mechanical pencils are best.</li> <li>Pen - black ink, fine point, quick drying (so you don't smudge it). Rapidographs are the best, but they cost a lot, so buy something cheaper instead.</li> <li>Colored pencils - don't bother getting anything expensive, and you don't need 10,000 colors either. The best are the &quot;Col-Erase&quot; eraseable colored pencils.</li> <li>Protractor and Ruler - essential.

These will be complemented by rotating tank experiments, which will offer the possibility of using a controlled laboratory environment to plan an experiment, explain ideas to be tested, observe and record the data.</p> <p>The projects will be introduced by means of written assignments and by brief introductory lectures, explaining the underlying physical and dynamical ideas. The lecture component will be minimal, with emphasis on the planning and discussion of each project by the students themselves.</p> <p>There are four projects, each of which takes approximately 3 weeks to complete:</p> <p>- Project 1: Mass and Wind<br /> - Project 2: Fronts<br /> - Project 3: Convection<br /> - Project 4: General Circulation</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Grading</h2> <p>Students will be asked to critically summarize the results of each project in a written 'Project Report', on which grades will be based. There is a new 'project theme' every three weeks (see <a href=\"/courses/earth-atmospheric-and-planetary-sciences/12-307-weather-and-climate-laboratory-spring-2009/calendar\">calendar</a>), a total of four during the semester. Each comprises an atmospheric data component and a fluids laboratory component.</p> <p>Students are also required to present their projects orally to the whole class. It is our intent to give to the students not only an opportunity to develop oral presentation skills but also a chance to discuss results with their piers.</p> <div class=\"help slide-bottom\"> <div class=\"help-message\"> <a class=\"help-engage\" href=\"javascript: trackEvents('Bottom Get Started','bottom get started Click','Help Overlay');\">Need help getting started?</a> <a href=\"javascript:disableHelpPopup(); trackEvents('Bottom Don\\'t Show','bottom don\\'t show Click','Help Overlay');\" class=\"help-dismiss\">Don't show me this again</a> </div> </div> <div class=\"help popup-center\"> <div class=\"help-message\"> <p class=\"help-dismiss\"><a href=\"javascript:disableHelpPopup(); trackEvents('Popup Don\\'t Show','popup don\\'t show Click','Help Overlay');\">Don't show me this again</a></p> <h2>Welcome!</h2> <p>This is one of over 2,200 courses on OCW.

As the physics and math involved are elementary, 12.409 does not make the brain-bashing problem-set demands characteristic of many other MIT courses.</p> <p>However, you will need to invest a fair amount of time and care in your work for the course, and the time investment tends to collide with some of your prime homework-time. Clear nights in Cambridge are rare enough that we must take full advantage of each one: sometimes we're extremely fortunate, with a section getting 5 to 7 clear nights during the term. Sometimes we're extremely UNfortunate, and a section gets only 2 or 1 (or less?) useful nights. As any given class night may be an 'observing night', you must be prepared to devote one entire evening each week to 12.409.</p> <p>12.409 uses six 8-inch reflecting telescopes; you'll be paired off and work two persons per scope. We set up the telescopes on campus until you've had enough experience to be able to take full advantage of a darker locale.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Grading</h2> <p>Your pass/fail grade will be determined using two criteria:</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Attendance</h2> <p>As 12.409 is a hands-on 'techniques and experience'-type course, we state the following for the record: in order to pass 12.409, you must attend your section each week. Actually, this will probably be the most challenging part of this seminar - arraying your other commitments to handle one night a week of observing.</p> <p>It's possible that, despite all your best efforts to pick a class night you can make every week, some unforeseen illness, personal emergency, or critical schedule conflict will crop up during the term on a class night and force an &quot;excusable&quot; absence. If this happens, contact your section instructor promptly, before the class if at all possible. We don't hassle you for one excusable absence, although it's virtually guaranteed to be on a clear night for your section. However, requests to excuse more than one absence are looked upon with extreme disfavor, and generally speaking are not granted except in extraordinary circumstances.</p> <p>A student puts it succinctly: &quot;two misses equals death.&quot;</p> <p>Normally to make-up a class we'll give you a written lab exercise to complete. It's difficult to arrange to make-up a class by attending another section, since sections of 12.409 are usually quite full and non-uniform weather causes them to diverge soon after the first week anyway.</p> <p>Absences for reasons under your control are not excused, such as &quot;punting&quot;, &quot;have to prepare for a quiz scheduled/paper due for the following morning&quot;, or &quot;unprepared for class&quot; (too tired, didn't bring warm clothes, etc.). In case of an unexcused absence you'll be encouraged to drop the subject and try again in some future term as an alternative to the failing grade you otherwise would receive. We also reserve the option of counting repeated tardiness as an unexcused absence.</p> <p>IF THIS SEEMS TOO EXTREME A TIME COMMITMENT, PLEASE RECONSIDER NOW WHETHER THIS SEMINAR IS REALLY THE RIGHT ONE FOR YOU!</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Observing Notebook</h2> <p>You'll need to have some sort of laboratory notebook to use for recording observations and writing calculations. In 12.409, it will be inspected by your instructor as a major criterion for evaluating your performance in the course.</p> <p>Please get yourself an observing notebook before your first 12.409 class. An 8.5- by 11-inch spiral-bound notebook of about 50 pages has always been more than enough for an entire term (even assuming piles of clear nights), so that's what we recommend. Some observers prefer a notebook with lined or graph-paper pages (to help in reproducing angles and making sketches) though plain paper should be adequate for our purposes. You need a notebook in which the pages are bound together, since looseleaf notebooks tend to be clumsy if you're out working on a windy rooftop. (Plus, fishing white looseleaf sheets out of a white snowdrift in the dark a few stories down is kind of a pain.) Spiral notebooks are particularly well-suited for 12.409 work: you can conveniently fold the cover all the way back, and can include your handouts using looseleaf rings. (Hint: avoid black covers; they're impossible to locate in the dark.) Please arrange to have this notebook be exclusively for your 12.409 work, so that its being collected for inspection won't deprive you of your notes for any other classes you may accidentally be taking. Please be certain also to bring your notebook to ALL class sessions (including the first one).</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Textbook</h2> <p>Most of the &quot;material&quot; (such as it is) for 12.409 is distributed as a set of handouts. However, if you don't yet know the major constellations and bright stars you should also purchase: Rey, H.A. <em>The Stars</em>. Boston, MA: Houghton Mifflin, 1976. ISBN: 0395245087. Even if you already know your way around the sky, but learned to picture the constellations by a method other than Rey's method of showing them, you might want to get yourself the book since we'll many times describe locations of stars by where they fit into Rey's pictures (e.g. &quot;Perseus' left armpit&quot;).</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Expected Student Preparation</h2> <p>Expected student preparation for an evening of observing includes coming to class on-time, awake, fed, and warmly dressed (see next paragraph).</p> <p>A few words about &quot;Evening Attire for the Sensible Observer&quot;:</p> <p>The reality of observing (or more properly, one reality, for there are several) is that you can get cold, all the way from late autumn through early spring. In particular, rooftops are almost always breezy (therefore cold) and Westford, MA is an &quot;outlying area&quot; (therefore cold). (Lest you think summer observing is completely trouble-free, forget not Mr. Mosquito.)</p> <p>When observing you'll want at least one EXTRA layer over whatever you usually find effective for a given air temperature; I recommend dressing as if the air temperature where you'll be observing were an extra 15 to 20 degrees lower than what the thermometer reads. This extra is necessary because for the most part you're NOT MOVING AROUND enough to generate any body heat that way. Here's what I wear for wintertime observing (since it's really un-cool for the instructor to get cold...):</p> <ul> <li>Long underwear (recommend two sets if T below 25 degrees F)</li> <li>Heavy trousers; heavy shirt (wise to bring wool sweater as well)</li> <li>Wool socks</li> <li>Hiking boots (mine aren't specifically insulated but they're made out of thick stuff; my wool socks do the insulating.) Insulated boots are good also; sneakers are usually inadequate and are NOT recommended.</li> <li>Wool neckwarmer or scarf</li> <li>Wool hat (Having some hat is CRUCIAL, since most of your body heat is lost through your head.)</li> <li>Warm gloves</li> </ul> <p>Like so many other things in life, observing is significantly less fun than it could be if you're underdressed for the occasion. So, if you err, arrange to do so on the side of preparedness: if you bring too many warm clothes you can always decide you need not wear all of them, but if you bring too few, you lose, in a most uncomfortable way.</p> <div class=\"help slide-bottom\"> <div class=\"help-message\"> <a class=\"help-engage\" href=\"javascript: trackEvents('Bottom Get Started','bottom get started Click','Help Overlay');\">Need help getting started?</a> <a href=\"javascript:disableHelpPopup(); trackEvents('Bottom Don\\'t Show','bottom don\\'t show Click','Help Overlay');\" class=\"help-dismiss\">Don't show me this again</a> </div> </div> <div class=\"help popup-center\"> <div class=\"help-message\"> <p class=\"help-dismiss\"><a href=\"javascript:disableHelpPopup(); trackEvents('Popup Don\\'t Show','popup don\\'t show Click','Help Overlay');\">Don't show me this again</a></p> <h2>Welcome!</h2> <p>This is one of over 2,200 courses on OCW.

Seismic imaging, geodynamical modeling, and noble gas analyses have provided spectacular new insight in the nature and scale of mantle convection. But despite the increased understanding and consensus within research groups there are significant outstanding issues, whose resolution requires cross-disciplinary study.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Objectives</h2> <p>The main objective of this cross-disciplinary course is to understand the historical development and the current status of ideas and models, to present and question the constraints from the different research fields, and to investigate if and how the different views on mantle flow can be reconciled with the currently available data.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Format</h2> <p>Each week faculty members will lecture on the basic physics and chemistry pertinent to the topic of that particular week. These lectures will be followed by literature discussions under leadership of (groups of) students. In this way we aim to cover the basic science as well as digest a substantial fraction of the pertinent literature; the group structure stimulates student interaction and helps reducing communication problems that often complicate cross-disciplinary discussion.</p> <p>Students work together in small (less than 4 students) cross-disciplinary, cross-institutional teams in order to improve the understanding and communication of multidisciplinary topics. The groups participate in the following activities:</p> <ul> <li>Every week, one group is responsible for summarizing the faculty/staff lecture and the related discussions and for preparing material that can be posted on-line; </li> <li>Every week, two (other) groups have a reading assignment (one or more papers, depending on length and difficulty) on the topic of the faculty/staff lecture. The students read and discuss the material; the student closest to the topic at hand (e.g., geochemistry) often has to educate his/her fellow students (who may be more familar with concepts of, say, seismology, mineral physics, or geodynamics) - and they present a 15 min summary to the rest of the class. </li> <li>There is a mid-term assignment for the groups, which consists of summarizing the issues discussed during the first half of the semester and of working on a small research problem. </li> <li>The final assignment takes the form of writing a &quot;research proposal&quot;; for this the students taking the class for credit need to reflect on the class, identify which problems are still open, and propose a research project that would address one or more of them. </li> </ul> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Prerequisites </h2> <p>None.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Grading </h2> <p>Grades will depend on quality of the mid-term and final assignments, the group presentations, the lecture notes, and general participation in the discussions, and they are determined in a final meeting of all staff responsible for the class. </p> <div class=\"help slide-bottom\"> <div class=\"help-message\"> <a class=\"help-engage\" href=\"javascript: trackEvents('Bottom Get Started','bottom get started Click','Help Overlay');\">Need help getting started?</a> <a href=\"javascript:disableHelpPopup(); trackEvents('Bottom Don\\'t Show','bottom don\\'t show Click','Help Overlay');\" class=\"help-dismiss\">Don't show me this again</a> </div> </div> <div class=\"help popup-center\"> <div class=\"help-message\"> <p class=\"help-dismiss\"><a href=\"javascript:disableHelpPopup(); trackEvents('Popup Don\\'t Show','popup don\\'t show Click','Help Overlay');\">Don't show me this again</a></p> <h2>Welcome!</h2> <p>This is one of over 2,200 courses on OCW.

The aim is to help students acquire an understanding of some of the basic concepts of fluid dynamics that will be needed as a foundation for advanced courses in atmospheric science, physical oceanography, ocean engineering, etc. The emphasis will be on fluid fundamentals, but with an atmosphere/ocean twist.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Expectations</h2> <p>It is presumed that students will have had a course in classical mechanics and differential equations, but no previous fluid dynamics experience (students who suspect that they may be significantly over or under qualified should contact the instructor). </p> <p>A basic understanding of vector and tensor notation and algebra is assumed, as is a basic understanding of wave kinematics (dispersion relations, group velocity, phase velocity, etc.). Specific applications of each will be covered in the course, but little introductory material will be given. Brief refresher lectures will be given outside of scheduled class time. It is also assumed that students will have a working knowledge of MatlabÂ®. If a student is lacking in any of these areas, they will be expected to bring themselves up to speed (students should feel free to contact the instructor for guidance).</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Course Components</h2> <p>The course has four main components: 1) lectures, 2) reading assignments, 3) problem sets, and 4) short quizzes.</p> <h3 class=\"subsubhead\">Lectures</h3> <p>The lectures are intended to introduce key concepts and to set them into the context of geophysical problems when appropriate. The lectures by themselves will not constitute an adequate introduction to fluid dynamics, and must be supplemented by reading assignments. Lectures will periodically be supplemented by short films.</p> <h3 class=\"subsubhead\">Reading</h3> <p>The primary textbooks will be <em>Fluid Mechanics</em> by P. Kundu and I. Cohen (2004) (hereafter KC04) and <em>Introduction to Geophysical FluidDynamics</em> by B. Cushman-Roisin (1994) (hereafter CR94). Both are strongly recommended for purchase. Three other useful texts are <em>Atmosphere-Ocean Dynamics</em> by A. E. Gill (1982) (hereafter G82), <em>Physical Fluid Dynamics</em> by D. J. Tritton (1988) (hereafter T88), and <em>An</em> <em>Introduction to Dynamic Meteorology</em> by J. R. Holton (1992) (hereafter H92). Another useful reference is the Online Publication: Price, James F. <a href=\"/resources/res-12-001-topics-in-fluid-dynamics-dimensional-analysis-the-coriolis-force-and-lagrangian-and-eulerian-representations-fall-2004/index.htm\"><em>Topics in Fluid Dynamics: Dimensional Analysis, the Coriolis Force, and Lagrangian and Eulerian Representations</em></a>. From time to time handouts from other sources will be provided in class or on the web. A basic guide to reading assignments is given in the readings section. More detailed reading assignments will be provided during class.</p> <h3 class=\"subsubhead\">Problem Sets</h3> <p>Problem sets will be assigned most weeks and will contribute significantly towards final grades. Homework assignments will be made during lectures and will be listed on the course web site. In general, late homework will not be accepted, although exceptions for extreme situations will be considered on a case-by-case basis.</p> <h3 class=\"subsubhead\">Quizzes</h3> <p>Very short quizzes will be given approximately once a week and will cover material <strong>not yet addressed in class</strong>. These quizzes will be based on reading assignments that will be given in class and are designed to motivate students to properly prepare for lectures. They will be given at the beginning of class and consist of a few true/false questions and one or two questions that require short calculations or written explanations. Answers to the quiz questions will be sought interactively from the students immediately upon completion of the quiz. The questions will provide a roadmap to the dayâs lecture and will hopefully facilitate interaction amongst the students and between the students and the instructor.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Exams and Grading</h2> <p>There will be a mid-term examination, and there will be a final examination to be scheduled during the final exam period. Grading will be apportioned roughly 40% exam(s) and 60% problem sets. Quizzes will only be used for grading if a student is on the boundary between grades, or if a student systematically ignores or performs poorly on the quizzes.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">References</h2> <p>Reading assignments will be made from KC04 and CR94. You should have a personal copy of KC04, and if you have the funds, a personal copy of CR94. Three additional books I find particularly useful are G82, T88, and H92. All books are on hold at the Lindgren Library and in the Physical Oceanography reading room.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0121782530/ref=nosim/mitopencourse-20\"><img alt=\"Buy at Amazon\" src=\"/images/a_logo_17.gif\" align=\"absMiddle\" border=\"0\" /></a> Kundu, P.

Only then are the basic equations derived in rigorous manner. The equations are then applied to important problems and methodologies in meteorology and climate, with discussions of the history of the topics where appropriate. Problems include the Hadley circulation and its role in the general circulation, atmospheric waves including gravity and Rossby waves and their interaction with the mean flow, with specific applications to the stratospheric quasi-biennial oscillation, tides, the super-rotation of Venus' atmosphere, the generation of atmospheric turbulence, and stationary waves among other problems. The quasi-geostrophic approximation is derived, and the resulting equations are used to examine the hydrodynamic stability of the circulation with applications ranging from convective adjustment to climate.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Learning Objectives</h2> <ol> <li>Develop an understanding of atmospheric dynamics in the context of observed phenomena.</li> <li>Develop the theory of the steady symmetric circulation (i.e., the Hadley Circulation) and its role in the general circulation. </li> <li>Develop the theory of internal gravity waves in general basic states, and develop the theory for how these waves interact with the mean flow. Applications to specific phenomena are emphasized.</li> <li>Isolate the impact of rotation in a spherical atmosphere, derive the quasi-geostrophic approximation, and apply this approximation to the study of Rossby waves. Again, applications (including the nature of stationary disturbances) are emphasized.</li> <li>Consider the instabilities of the atmosphere in a generalized context wherein instabilities include all eddies that extract their energy from the mean flow. Examine the role of these eddies in climate.</li> </ol> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Homework</h2> <p>The course notes have 13 chapters, and at the end of each (except the first introductory chapter) are exercises that constitute the homework for the course. Solutions to the exercises are due within two weeks of the completion of each chapter in class. This homework is graded though the grades are weighted according to their difficulty. In addition, there is a take home final exam.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Grades</h2> <p>The final grade is determined by the grade on the take home exam, though if the homework grades are better than the grade on the final exam, the final grade will be improved.</p> <div class=\"help slide-bottom\"> <div class=\"help-message\"> <a class=\"help-engage\" href=\"javascript: trackEvents('Bottom Get Started','bottom get started Click','Help Overlay');\">Need help getting started?</a> <a href=\"javascript:disableHelpPopup(); trackEvents('Bottom Don\\'t Show','bottom don\\'t show Click','Help Overlay');\" class=\"help-dismiss\">Don't show me this again</a> </div> </div> <div class=\"help popup-center\"> <div class=\"help-message\"> <p class=\"help-dismiss\"><a href=\"javascript:disableHelpPopup(); trackEvents('Popup Don\\'t Show','popup don\\'t show Click','Help Overlay');\">Don't show me this again</a></p> <h2>Welcome!</h2> <p>This is one of over 2,200 courses on OCW.

Topics include consumer theory, producer theory, the behavior of firms, market equilibrium, monopoly, and the role of the government in the economy. 14.01 is a Humanities, Arts, and Social Sciences (HASS) elective and is offered both terms.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Prerequisites</h2> <p>Knowledge of <em>18.01 Calculus I</em> is helpful. There are no other prerequisites.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Course Format</h2> <p>14.01 is offered in two formats. Both use the same textbook, cover the same topics and have the same requirements, including exams. 14.01 is a 3-0-9 course (3 hours of class plus 9 hours of preparation).</p> <h3 class=\"subsubhead\">Format 1: Lecture-recitation</h3> <p>Students attend one-hour lectures on Mondays and Wednesdays. Students also attend 1 hour recitations on Fridaysâthese are not optional. Instructors will introduce new material at these recitations which will be part of problem sets and exams.</p> <h3 class=\"subsubhead\">Format 2: Discussion Sections</h3> <p>Students attend three one-hour sections weekly on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Selecting a Format</h2> <p>During the first 2 weeks of the semester, students may switch between formats. At the due date of the first homework (see below) students must submit the completed assignment at the recitation or section of their choice. This submission will automatically enroll them in that choice. Thereafter you can change only with special Faculty approval. If sessions are extremely unbalanced, the Faculty reserves the right to re-assign students.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Textbook</h2> <p><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0130084611/ref=nosim/mitopencourse-20\"><img border=\"0\" align=\"absMiddle\" src=\"/images/a_logo_17.gif\" alt=\"Buy at Amazon\" /></a> Pindyck, Robert S., and Daniel L. Rubinfeld. <em>Microeconomics</em>. 6th ed. Upper Saddle River, NJ: Pearson Prentice Hall, 2004. ISBN: 9780130084613 .</p> <p>The book is also available in digital format from <a href=\"http://www.coursesmart.com/0130084611\">CourseSmart</a>.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Problem Sets, Exams, and Grading</h2> <p>The final grade in the course will be based on the following percentages:</p> <div class=\"maintabletemplate\"> <table summary=\"See table caption for summary.\" class=\"tablewidth50\"> <caption class=\"invisible\">Grading criteria.</caption> <thead align=\"left\"> <tr> <th scope=\"col\">ACTIVITIES</th> <th scope=\"col\">PERCENTAGES</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody align=\"left\"> <tr class=\"row\"> <td>Homework (best 9 of 10, 3% each)</td> <td>27%</td> </tr> <tr class=\"alt-row\"> <td>Exam 1</td> <td>23%</td> </tr> <tr class=\"row\"> <td>Exam 2</td> <td>23%</td> </tr> <tr class=\"alt-row\"> <td>Exam 3</td> <td>23%</td> </tr> <tr class=\"row\"> <td>Class participation</td> <td>4%</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> </div> <p> </p> <p>There will be 10 mandatory problem sets which will be individually graded and returned to the students. At the end of the term students will have the best 9 homework grades cumulated up and this will count for 27% of the final course grade. Problem sets are due on the indicated days in class. Late problem sets will not be accepted.</p> <p>There will be 3 exams held throughout the term, two at night and one during the final exam period (see <a href=\"#Calendar\">calendar</a> below). Each exam will each cover roughly 1/3 of the course material, will be 1.5 hours long and will count as 23% (collectively 69%) of the grade. The remaining 4% of the grade will come from class participation.</p> <p>Exams and homework will draw heavily on class/lecture material in addition to the textbook.</p> <p>At the end of the semester, the faculty will report <strong>internal</strong> grades to the MIT registrar with + and - modifiers, where appropriate, and only for grades A, B, C. The faculty will be happy to <strong>regrade</strong> any problem set or exam â <strong>in entirety</strong>. Consequently it is possible for your revised grade to fall as well as rise. If you are an MIT freshman, the faculty will evaluate your performance on the first exam and first 3 problem sets and if it falls below passing, we will send out a warning to you and your advisor.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Conflicts and Makeup Exams</h2> <p>Conflicts must be received by the head TA <strong>at least one week prior</strong> to the exam.</p> <p>Illness on the day of the exam: If you should happen to be sick the day of the exam, contact one of the Deans in Student Support Services to verify your illness and let the head TA know.</p> <p>A fixed makeup exam time will be scheduled by the head TA.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Tutoring</h2> <p>Students are encouraged to seek help from the faculty and their assistants. An undergraduate TA will be in charge of offering tutorial help.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Calendar</h2> <p>The calendars for the two formats are similar but not identical in terms of class meetings. They are presented separately below. The calendar for Format 2 can be found <a href=\"#Format_2\">here</a>.</p> <h3 class=\"subsubhead\">Format 1: Lecture-recitation</h3> <p>The calendar below provides information on the course's lecture

Industrial organization focuses on firm behavior in imperfectly competitive markets, which appear to be far more common than the perfectly competitive markets that were the focus of your basic microeconomics course. This field analyzes the acquisition and use of market power by firms, strategic interactions among firms, and the role of government competition policy. We will approach this subject from both theoretical and applied perspectives. Students must have completed at least an introductory semester of microeconomics at the level of 14.01 before enrolling in 14.20.</p> <p>The course will rely heavily on the required textbook by Jeffrey Church and Roger Ware, <em>Industrial Organization: A Strategic Approach</em> (Irwin McGraw-Hill, 2000, 1st edition). The text is denoted on the reading list as &quot;C&amp;W.&quot; Occasional additional readings (typically short news articles) may be handed out in the lecture preceding their discussion. Students are encouraged to scan the <em>Wall Street Journal</em>, <em>Financial Times</em>, business section of the <em>New York Times</em>, or <em>The Economist</em> magazine for articles relevant to the topics covered in the course.</p> <p>You are responsible for ALL assigned readings. It is particularly important that you do the application readings and prepare any discussion questions BEFORE CLASS. These form the basis of class discussion, in which you are expected to participate and which will be graded.</p> <p>The requirements for the course, in addition to attendance and participation in class discussion, include problem sets, a set of group assignments based on the Competitive Strategy Game, and a midterm and final examination. Please read the requirements and expectations statements that follow, and ask if you're confused about anything.</p> <p>NOTE: This course requires consistent and sustained work over the term, on a weekly or more frequent basis. It is not well-suited to a &quot;let it ride, cram before the exam&quot; strategy. If that's what you need to make your schedule work, this isn't the course for you.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Grading</h2> <p>Students are asked to submit their answers to the Student Information Form (<a href=\"/courses/economics/14-20-industrial-organization-and-public-policy-spring-2003/syllabus/studentinfo.pdf\">PDF</a>) at the start of the term.</p> <p><strong>Required assignments and their weight for determining your final 14.20 grade:</strong></p> <div class=\"maintabletemplate\"><table summary=\"See table caption for summary.\" class=\"tablewidth75\"> <caption class=\"invisible\">Grading information.</caption> <thead align=\"left\"> <tr> <th scope=\"col\">WEIGHT IN FINAL GRADE</th> <th scope=\"col\">REQUIRED ASSIGNMENT</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody align=\"left\"> <tr class=\"row\"> <td>5%</td> <td><p><strong>Participation in Class Discussion</strong> (cumulated over term)<br /> This requires your attendance at lectures and completing readings in advance!

Your enrollment in 14.20 signifies your agreement to attend all lectures, participate actively in the discussions, and complete all required assignments.</p> <p>The name(s) on the top of an assignment records everyone who has contributed to that assignment. If yours is the only name (e.g. on exams or problem sets), you affirm that the work is yours alone.</p> <p>Discussing problem sets with other students, or seeking help from the TA or professor, is permitted and encouraged, <strong>but you must write up the solution</strong> yourself in your own words. If you do discuss problem sets with other student(s), you should record their name(s) as part of your &quot;Study Group&quot; for that problem set.</p> <p>Copying from another student's assignment or permitting another student to copy from your assignment will result in a &quot;0&quot; for that assignment for all involved students.</p> <p>Giving or obtaining help during an exam, including but not limited to copying, or changing exam answers at any time after the time has been called on an exam, will result in a &quot;0&quot; for the exam and referral to the Committee on Discipline.</p> <p>Late assignments will NOT be accepted.</p> <p>Requests to re-grade an assignment must be made <strong>in writing</strong> to Professor Rose within 3 days of receiving your graded work. For requests other than numerical errors in adding up points the entire assignment will be regarded.

Topics include elements of probability theory, sampling theory, statistical estimation, and hypothesis testing.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Prerequisites</h2> <p>No prior preparation in probability in statistics is required, but familiarity with basic algebra and calculus (single and multi-variable) is assumed.

You are expected to complete the problem sets on your own and without consulting old problem set solutions - it will clearly be in your interest to understand all of the material on them. If you fail to turn in more than two problem sets, you can't get a course grade better than D. The overall problem set score for the class will be calculated based on your seven best problem set grades, so you can miss out on one problem set without affecting your grade.</p> <p>The exams are non-cumulative, with the first two offered in-class and the third offered during final exam week. The exams will be closed book unless otherwise indicated.</p> <p>Regular attendance at the recitation is strongly recommended, as the TA will discuss problem sets, clarify lecture material, and provide other useful guidance.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Course Policies</h2> <h3 class=\"subsubhead\">Problem Sets</h3> <p>Problem sets are designed to help you learn how to apply the material presented in lectures and recitations. You are permitted to discuss course material, including homework, with other students in the class. However, you must turn in your own individual solutions to each set of homework problems. Discussion with others is intended to clarify ideas, concepts, and technical questions, not to derive group homework set solutions. Identical homework set answers (especially when the steps used to derive answers are not shown or when questions of interpretation are involved) violate this policy and may receive no credit. Also, you are expected to complete the problem sets without consulting old problem set solutions.</p> <h3 class=\"subsubhead\">Problem Set Solutions</h3> <p>Handwritten solutions are fine, as long as they are legible and neat. Please remember: if we can't read it, we can't grade it.</p> <h3 class=\"subsubhead\">Lateness</h3> <p>In fairness to students who complete assignments on time, late homework sets will not be accepted. You may turn in assignments during the lecture on the day they are due. After the lecture, assignments may be placed in a designated box. Do not leave assignments in the instructors' offices or mailboxes. Because late homework will not be accepted you will be allowed to drop your lowest homework score. You can also e-mail your answers before the deadline, for alternative submissions you should ask the instructors for permission beforehand.</p> <h3 class=\"subsubhead\">Exams</h3> <p>Taking all three exams is a requirement of the course. Missing an exam without a valid excuse will result in a failing grade for the entire course.</p> <h3 class=\"subsubhead\">Absences</h3> <p>To be considered valid, an excuse must be proffered prior to the exam that is to be missed, if at all possible, the excuse must be in writing, and it must be verifiable. These criteria are necessary but not sufficient, however. We reserve the right to deem an excuse meeting the above criteria invalid. Any medical excuse must be accompanied by a dated note from the MIT Medical Center. Regardless of the reason for missing the exam, you must get advanced clearance from the Dean of Student Support Services.</p> <h3 class=\"subsubhead\">Make-up Exams</h3> <p>An oral make-up exam will be given in the event of a valid excuse.</p> <h3 class=\"subsubhead\">Regrades</h3> <p>All requests for regrades must be submitted in writing within one week of the exam being handed back. The entire exam will be regraded; it is therefore possible that a regrade could result in a lower score.</p> <h3 class=\"subsubhead\">Academic Integrity</h3> <p>Cheating or academic dishonesty in any form will not be tolerated and will result in swift punitive action. This includes but is not restricted to copying information from other students' exams, communicating with other students during exams, failing to follow the rules of the exams regarding notes, calculators, etc., altering an exam for the purpose of a regrade, and producing fraudulent written excuses. Any student found to have cheated or behaved unethically or dishonestly will be given a grade of F on the exam involved and referred to the appropriate disciplinary committees within MIT for further action.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Grading</h2> <div class=\"maintabletemplate\"><table class=\"tablewidth50\" summary=\"See table caption for summary.\"> <caption class=\"invisible\">Grading criteria.</caption> <thead align=\"left\"> <tr> <th scope=\"col\">ACTIVITIES</th> <th scope=\"col\">PERCENTAGES</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody align=\"left\"> <tr class=\"row\"> <td>Problem sets</td> <td>25%</td> </tr> <tr class=\"alt-row\"> <td>Exam 1</td> <td>25%</td> </tr> <tr class=\"row\"> <td>Exam 2</td> <td>25%</td> </tr> <tr class=\"alt-row\"> <td>Exam 3</td> <td>25%</td> </tr> </tbody> </table></div> <div class=\"help slide-bottom\"> <div class=\"help-message\"> <a class=\"help-engage\" href=\"javascript: trackEvents('Bottom Get Started','bottom get started Click','Help Overlay');\">Need help getting started?</a> <a href=\"javascript:disableHelpPopup(); trackEvents('Bottom Don\\'t Show','bottom don\\'t show Click','Help Overlay');\" class=\"help-dismiss\">Don't show me this again</a> </div> </div> <div class=\"help popup-center\"> <div class=\"help-message\"> <p class=\"help-dismiss\"><a href=\"javascript:disableHelpPopup(); trackEvents('Popup Don\\'t Show','popup don\\'t show Click','Help Overlay');\">Don't show me this again</a></p> <h2>Welcome!</h2> <p>This is one of over 2,200 courses on OCW.

The goal is to spell out various policy options and to quantify the trade-offs between them. We will study the different facets of human development: education, health, gender, the family, land relations, risk, informal and formal norms and institutions. This is an empirical class. For each topic, we will study several concrete examples chosen from around the world. While studying each of these topics, we will ask: What determines the decisions of poor households in developing countries? What constraints are they subject to? Is there a scope for policy (by government, international organizations, or non-governmental organizations (NGOs))? What policies have been tried out? Have they been successful?</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Prerequisites</h2> <p>A microeconomics and a statistics course are prerequisites. Examples are <em>14.01 Principles of Microeconomics</em> and <em>14.30 Introduction to Statistical Methods in Economics</em>. Econometrics is not a prerequisite for this class, but you will be expected to be willing to familiarize yourself with basic econometric methods. The relevant material will be covered in class and occasionally in the recitation.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Textbooks and Readings</h2> <p>The textbook for this class is Debraj Ray's <em>Development Economics</em>. However, we will rely mostly on articles. There are many readings for this class. You are not expected to read every single article in detail, but you are expected to understand the methods used by the authors to reach their conclusions. Required readings are starred. Lecture notes will be distributed at each lecture. They are not a substitute for attending the class, but rather a study aid.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0691017069/ref=nosim/mitopencourse-20\"><img border=\"0\" align=\"absMiddle\" alt=\"Buy at Amazon\" src=\"/images/a_logo_17.gif\" /></a> Ray, Debraj. <a href=\"http://press.princeton.edu/titles/6315.html\"><em>Development Economics</em></a>. Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 1998. ISBN: 9780691017068.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Requirements</h2> <h3 class=\"subsubhead\">Problem Sets</h3> <p>There will be about one problem set every 2 or 3 lectures (for a total of 6 problem sets), with each one due a week after it is handed out. Problem sets will contain empirical exercises, theory exercises, and written assignments developing a policy idea that will culminate in your class presentation. In the first few recitations, you will learn how to use Stata software to complete these exercises. Problem sets for this class are very important, and somewhat time-consuming.</p> <h3 class=\"subsubhead\">Presentations</h3> <p>Students will work in pairs to develop a program proposal throughout the semester that addresses a need or problem in a developing country. Students must identify a problem, research the underlying causes, and come up with a program that may help address the problem. Each group of students is required to present their findings during brief class presentations, approximately 5 minutes long. <strong>Class presentations will take place Ses #15 and #16</strong>.</p> <h3 class=\"subsubhead\">Exams</h3> <p>This class has two equally weighted exams. <strong>There will be a mid-term exam after Ses #12 and a final exam during exam week</strong>.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Grading</h2> <p>The grade is based on the following activities.

Some parts of the course are designed to teach material that all graduate students should know. Others are used to introduce methodologies. Topics include consumer and producer theory, markets and competition, general equilibrium, and tools of comparative statics and their application to price theory. Some topics of recent interest may also be covered.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Prerequisites</h2> <p>Prerequisites for this course include <em>14.04 Intermediate Microeconomic Theory</em>, <em>18.02 Multivariable</em> <em>Calculus</em>, and <em>18.06 Linear Algebra</em>.</p> <p>Enrollment in this course is limited and permission of the instructor is required. Permission can be obtained by attending the first class meeting and providing information about previous coursework in mathematics and economics. The course assumes that students have taken undergraduate intermediate microeconomics classes. It also assumes that students are comfortable with multivariable calculus and linear algebra and have had some exposure to real analysis. Historically, many students from outside the economics department have had difficulty with the course. The enrollment limit may result in well-qualified students being turned away.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Textbooks</h2> <p><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0195073401/ref=nosim/mitopencourse-20\"><img border=\"0\" align=\"absMiddle\" src=\"/images/a_logo_17.gif\" alt=\"Buy at Amazon\" /></a> Mas-Collel, Andreu, Michael D.

They will be graded on a check-, check, check+ basis. The grades are intended primarily to give you an idea of how you are doing in the course and will affect course grades only for students with borderline scores on the exam. You may work in groups, but please do the write-ups individually. We do not expect to see identical answers from different students. An optional seventh problem set will be distributed.</p> <p>The final exam will be held two days after the last lecture.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\"><a name=\"Calendar\" id=\"Calendar\"></a><a

The course is intended both for graduate students who wish to develop a solid background in game theory in order to pursue research in the applied fields of economics and related disciplines, and for students wishing to specialize in economic theory. While the course is designed for graduate students in economics, it is open to all students who have taken and passed 14.121.</p> <p>The recommended primary text for the course is Drew Fudenberg and Jean Tirole's text, <em>Game Theory</em> (MIT Press, 1991). The text covers all the material in the course and much more, but has less in the way of intuition and examples than some students would like. For this reason, students might alternatively wish to use Robert Gibbons' <em>Game Theory for Applied Economists</em> (Princeton University Press, 1992) as their primary reference. Gibbons' book contains more readable discussions of the material and a lot of nice examples, but omits a few of the topics we'll cover.</p> <p>The course will be graded on the basis of five problem sets and a three-hour final exam. In order to learn the material it is absolutely essential to do the problem sets. The problem sets will count for approximately one-fourth of the course grade. Five graded problem sets will be due during the term of the course. One week after the last problem set is due an optional sixth problem will be discussed in recitation. The final exam will be held in the week after.

We will spend most of the course reading and discussing research papers. The first few classes I will have lectures on some important background material. Once the basics are covered, we will develop some of the recent themes of market design with an emphasis on areas where there has been recent activity, and where I think there is scope for additional work. Some of this will be open-ended and the idea is to spur discussion. It will be <strong>critical that students read the papers in this class</strong> to facilitate the discussion and depending on enrollment and participation, we may ask students to present papers.</p> <h3 class=\"subsubhead\">Course Requirements</h3> <p>The requirements for this course are to write three referee reports and a research paper. The referee reports are due on Ses #3, Ses #5, and Ses #7. The papers students may write referee reports on are labeled in the <a href=\"/courses/economics/14-147-topics-in-game-theory-fall-2009/readings\">readings</a>. If there is a paper that you think is relevant which is not on the list, please come see me.</p> <p>A short progress report on the research paper is due one week after Ses #7, and the final paper is due at the end of the January Independent Activities Period (IAP), with no exceptions. The hope is that good papers form a foundation for dissertation work. I will meet with students in the middle of January to check the progress of the paper.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Grading</h2> <div class=\"maintabletemplate\"><table summary=\"See table caption for summary.\" class=\"tablewidth50\"> <caption class=\"invisible\">Grading criteria.</caption> <thead align=\"left\"> <tr> <th scope=\"col\">ACTIVITIES</th> <th scope=\"col\">PERCENTAGES</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody align=\"left\"> <tr class=\"row\"> <td>Participation</td> <td>20%</td> </tr> <tr class=\"alt-row\"> <td>Referee reports (10% each)</td> <td>30%</td> </tr> <tr class=\"row\"> <td>Final paper</td> <td>50%</td> </tr> </tbody> </table></div> <p> </p> <h2 class=\"subhead\"><a name=\"Calendar\" id=\"Calendar\"></a>Calendar</h2> <div class=\"maintabletemplate\"><table summary=\"See table caption for summary.\" class=\"tablewidth75\"> <caption class=\"invisible\">Course calendar.</caption> <thead align=\"left\"> <tr> <th scope=\"col\">SES #</th> <th scope=\"col\">TOPICS</th> <th scope=\"col\">KEY DATES</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody align=\"left\"> <tr class=\"row\"> <td>1</td> <td>Introduction and motivations</td> <td> </td> </tr> <tr class=\"alt-row\"> <td>2</td> <td>Basic mechanism design and auction theory</td> <td> </td> </tr> <tr class=\"row\"> <td>3</td> <td>More mechanism design and auction theory</td> <td>Referee report 1 due</td> </tr> <tr class=\"alt-row\"> <td>4</td> <td>One-sided matching: house allocation and market problems</td> <td> </td> </tr> <tr class=\"row\"> <td>5</td> <td>Two-sided matching: stability, many-to-one vs. one-to-one, and small cores in large markets</td> <td>Referee report 2 due</td> </tr> <tr class=\"alt-row\"> <td>6</td> <td>Stochastic matching mechanisms</td> <td> </td> </tr> <tr class=\"row\"> <td>7</td> <td>Student assignment and school choice</td> <td>Referee report 3 due, final paper proposal due 1 week after Ses #7, and final paper due 6 weeks after Ses #7</td> </tr> </tbody> </table></div> <div class=\"help slide-bottom\"> <div class=\"help-message\"> <a class=\"help-engage\" href=\"javascript: trackEvents('Bottom Get Started','bottom get started Click','Help Overlay');\">Need help getting started?</a> <a href=\"javascript:disableHelpPopup(); trackEvents('Bottom Don\\'t Show','bottom don\\'t show Click','Help Overlay');\" class=\"help-dismiss\">Don't show me this again</a> </div> </div> <div class=\"help popup-center\"> <div class=\"help-message\"> <p class=\"help-dismiss\"><a href=\"javascript:disableHelpPopup(); trackEvents('Popup Don\\'t Show','popup don\\'t show Click','Help Overlay');\">Don't show me this again</a></p> <h2>Welcome!</h2> <p>This is one of over 2,200 courses on OCW.

The course introduces the classic papers and some recent research. The material is organized into the following modules:</p> <ul> <li>Module 1: Boundaries of the firm</li> <li>Module 2: Employment in organizations</li> <li>Module 3: Decision-making in organizations</li> <li>Module 4: Structures and processes in organizations</li> </ul> <p>Each class session covers a few leading papers.</p> <p>This course was joint-taught between faculty of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Harvard University. The Harvard course is <em>Economics 2670 Organizational Economics</em>.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Prerequisites</h2> <p>The prerequisites are first-year graduate microeconomics (<em>Economics 2010a Economic Theory</em> and <em>2010b Economic Theory</em> at Harvard or the <em>14.121-14.124 Microeconomic Theory I-IV</em> sequence at MIT). In addition students should be familiar and comfortable with the material on incentives and control discussed in the following readings:</p> <p>Gibbons, Robert. &quot;Incentives Between Firms (and Within).&quot; <em>Management Science</em> 51 (2005): 2-17 (sections 2-4).</p> <p>âââ. &quot;Four Formal(izable) Theories of the Firm?&quot; <em>Journal of Economic Behavior and Organization</em> 58 (2005): 202-247 (section 2).</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Deliverables</h2> <p>There are three deliverables for credit in the course. The first is a set of three short <strong>model-development essays</strong> , corresponding to the class sessions devoted to discussing case studies (Ses #7, #9, and #20). There are also cases (marked by &quot;C&quot;) in some other class sessions; one such case can be the basis for one model-development essay.</p> <p>In addition to the model-development essays, there are two other requirements: a <strong>review essay</strong> on one of the draft chapters of <em>The Handbook of Organizational Economics</em> (marked by &quot;H&quot;) and a <strong>final paper</strong> on any topic of interest to you relating to the material in the course.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Grading</h2> <div class=\"maintabletemplate\"><table class=\"tablewidth50\" summary=\"See table caption for summary.\"> <caption class=\"invisible\">Grading criteria.</caption> <thead align=\"left\"> <tr> <th scope=\"col\">ACTIVITIES</th> <th scope=\"col\">WEIGHTS</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody align=\"left\"> <tr class=\"row\"> <td>Model-development essays (3)</td> <td>1/3</td> </tr> <tr class=\"alt-row\"> <td>Handbook-review paper</td> <td>1/6</td> </tr> <tr class=\"row\"> <td>Final paper</td> <td>1/2</td> </tr> </tbody> </table></div> <div class=\"help slide-bottom\"> <div class=\"help-message\"> <a class=\"help-engage\" href=\"javascript: trackEvents('Bottom Get Started','bottom get started Click','Help Overlay');\">Need help getting started?</a> <a href=\"javascript:disableHelpPopup(); trackEvents('Bottom Don\\'t Show','bottom don\\'t show Click','Help Overlay');\" class=\"help-dismiss\">Don't show me this again</a> </div> </div> <div class=\"help popup-center\"> <div class=\"help-message\"> <p class=\"help-dismiss\"><a href=\"javascript:disableHelpPopup(); trackEvents('Popup Don\\'t Show','popup don\\'t show Click','Help Overlay');\">Don't show me this again</a></p> <h2>Welcome!</h2> <p>This is one of over 2,200 courses on OCW.

Recitation assignments will be posted. You should attend your assigned recitation over the course of the term. If you must change your recitation assignment after the first week of the term, please inform your TA or the head TA.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Tutorials</h2> <p>Tutorials will be held in the TA offices within the Lab during the beginning of the week and during the weeks when there is no lab in progress. Tutorial hours will be assigned and posted. Tutorials cancelled due to holidays will be rescheduled by your TA. Extra tutorials to address particularly challenging material will be scheduled throughout the term, depending on student demand; if you have interest in receiving extra help on a particular topic, please contact the head TA.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Textbook</h2> <p>The course textbook is:</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1558607358/ref=nosim/mitopencourse-20\"><img border=\"0\" align=\"absMiddle\" src=\"/images/a_logo_17.gif\" alt=\"Buy at Amazon\" /></a> Agarwal, Anant, and Jeffrey H.

San Mateo, CA: Morgan Kaufmann Publishers, Elsevier, July 2005. ISBN: 9781558607354.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Homework</h2> <p>Homework will be issued in lectures and collected a week later in recitation. Corrected homework with solutions will be returned in tutorials the week after it is collected. You are welcome and encouraged to discuss the homework among your colleagues. However, the final formulation and write up of your homework answers must be your own. Submitting homework copied from someone else is a breach of ethics, and will be handled by the Committee on Discipline. More importantly, although homework counts for only 5 percent of the grade, they are critical to learning the material and to doing well on the quizzes and final exam. <strong>One homework problem will appear in each of the tests</strong>, and homework performance will be taken into account during grade assignment for cases that are on letter-grade boundaries.</p> <p><strong>Late homework will not be accepted for grading</strong>. However, total homework grades will be based on the best nine out of eleven individual homework grades. Thus, with one exception, two homework assignments may be missed without a grading penalty. <strong>The one exception is Homework #11, which is mandatory</strong>. Homework #11 will be a two-week design assignment that will also serve as the pre-lab exercises for Lab #4.</p> <p>All homework will be graded on a coarse scale of 0 to 3 points. 3 points if all or nearly all problems are correct, 2 points if homework is approximately half correct, 1 point if mostly incorrect, and 0 points if late or not submitted.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Labs</h2> <p>Labs will be conducted during the weeks shown in the schedule. Each lab assignment involves one or more accomplishments which must be checked off by a TA in the lab. TAs will be available for help and lab check-off during those weeks in which a lab is in progress. Individual lab hours will be assigned and posted on the 6.002 Web site. Written lab work for labs 1 through 3, which is to be completed in a lab notebook, will be due in recitation on the day following the week of the lab. No written work will be due for the last lab. You are welcome and encouraged to discuss the labs among your colleagues. You are also welcome to team up in pairs to execute a lab. However, the write up of your lab must be done on your own. Skipping the lab and submitting work copied from someone else is a serious breach of ethics, and will be handled by the Committee on Discipline.</p> <p>Lab assignments will be graded on a scale of 0 to 3 (3: lab complete, works, good job on pre- and post-lab; 2: lab mostly complete, reasonable job on pre and post lab; 1: lab partially done, marginal to poor job on pre- and post-lab; 0: lab not done, poor job on pre- and post-lab).</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Lab Books</h2> <p>You must obtain a thin square-ruled hard cover notebook for recording measurements, observations and graphs of data taken during the in-lab exercises. Written pre-lab and post-lab exercises are also to be completed in your lab notebook. Your lab notebook must be turned in for grading during recitation following the lab week; it will be returned before the next lab.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Quizzes</h2> <p>Two closed-book evening quizzes will be given in 6.002 this term. The first quiz will take place 3 days after R9, while the second quiz will occur 1 day after L18. Both quizzes will have a two-hour duration. There will be no lecture or recitation on the day of either quiz. <strong>You may bring one two-sided sheet of notes to each quiz</strong>. You may also bring a calculator.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Final Exam</h2> <p>A three-hour final exam will be given during the end-of-term exam week. Timing and room assignments will be announced later. <strong>You may bring three two-sided sheets of notes to the exam</strong>.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Grading</h2> <p>Initial grading will be based on the following weighting:</p> <div class=\"maintabletemplate\"><table summary=\"See table caption for summary.\" class=\"tablewidth50\"> <caption class=\"invisible\">Grading criteria.</caption> <thead align=\"left\"> <tr> <th scope=\"col\">ACTIVITIES</th> <th scope=\"col\">PERCENTAGES</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody align=\"left\"> <tr class=\"row\"> <td>Homework</td> <td>5%</td> </tr> <tr class=\"alt-row\"> <td>Labs</td> <td>5%</td> </tr> <tr class=\"row\"> <td>Quizzes (25% each)</td> <td>50%</td> </tr> <tr class=\"alt-row\"> <td>Final exam</td> <td>40%</td> </tr> </tbody> </table></div> <p>This will be followed by considerable discussion among the entire teaching staff to factor in your diligence on the homework and labs, and your participation in class and tutorials. This discussion can affect your letter grade for the course, particularly if your initial grade is on a letter-grade boundary.</p> <p>Furthermore, failure to complete the labs in this subject will result in an overall grade that is one letter grade lower (not an Incomplete).</p> <p>This subject has been designed so that lectures, recitations, tutorials, homework and labs are integral and essential parts of the learning process. Although there is no specific reward for participation, there is a clearly defined penalty for not participating. Students who consistently miss recitations, tutorials, homework and labs will not be included in the grading discussions.</p> <div class=\"help slide-bottom\"> <div class=\"help-message\"> <a class=\"help-engage\" href=\"javascript: trackEvents('Bottom Get Started','bottom get started Click','Help Overlay');\">Need help getting started?</a> <a href=\"javascript:disableHelpPopup(); trackEvents('Bottom Don\\'t Show','bottom don\\'t show Click','Help Overlay');\" class=\"help-dismiss\">Don't show me this again</a> </div> </div> <div class=\"help popup-center\"> <div class=\"help-message\"> <p class=\"help-dismiss\"><a href=\"javascript:disableHelpPopup(); trackEvents('Popup Don\\'t Show','popup don\\'t show Click','Help Overlay');\">Don't show me this again</a></p> <h2>Welcome!</h2> <p>This is one of over 2,200 courses on OCW.

                    "syllabus": "<div id=\"course_inner_section\"> <p class=\"instruction\">This course makes use of Athena, MIT's UNIX-based computing environment. OCW does not provide access to this environment.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Course Meeting Times</h2> <p>Lectures: 2 sessions / week, 1 hour / session</p> <p>Recitations: 2 sessions / week, 1 hour / session</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Course Description</h2> <p>6.004 offers an introduction to the engineering of digital systems. Starting with MOS transistors, the course develops a series of building blocks â logic gates, combinational and sequential circuits, finite-state machines, computers and finally complete systems. Both hardware and software mechanisms are explored through a series of design examples.</p> <p>6.004 is required material for any EECS undergraduate who wants to understand (and ultimately design) digital systems. A good grasp of the material is essential for later courses in digital design, computer architecture and systems. Before taking 6.004, students should feel comfortable using computers; a rudimentary knowledge of programming language concepts (6.001) and electrical fundamentals (6.002) is assumed.</p> <p>The problem sets and lab exercises are intended to give students &quot;hands-on&quot; experience in designing digital systems; each student completes a gate-level design for a reduced instruction set computer (RISC) processor during the semester. Access to workstations as well as help from the course staff is provided in the lab but it is possible to complete the assignments using Athena machines or one's home computer. Students are encouraged to get help from others in understanding the material, but the designs and measurements they hand in must be their own work.</p> <p>6.004 Learning Objectives and Measurable Outcomes (<a href=\"/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-004-computation-structures-spring-2009/syllabus/MIT6_004s09_syll_objectives.pdf\">PDF</a>)</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Prerequisites</h2> <p>Students should feel comfortable using computers. A rudimentary knowledge of programming language concepts (C language or 6.001) and electrical fundamentals (6.002) is assumed. Each student must have an Athena account to access the software used to complete the lab assignments.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Text</h2> <p>There is no required text for the course this semester. Readings for some of the course material will be available on-line.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Problem Sets</h2> <p>There are no weekly graded problem sets. Instead there are on-line tutorial problems with answers you can use to test your understanding of the material. The recitations give you a chance to work on these problems with the help of the course staff and to ask any questions that you may have.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Collaboration</h2> <p>The assignments are intended to help you understand the material and should be done individually. You are welcome to get help from others but the work you hand in must be your own. Copying another person's work or allowing your work to be copied by others is a serious academic offense and will be treated as such. We do spot-check submissions to the on-line checkoff system for infractions of the collaboration policy. So please don't tempt fate by submitting someone else's work as your own; it will save us all a lot of grief.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Labs</h2> <p>There are eight lab assignments due at various times during the term and an optional design project at the end of the term. Completing each part of a lab earns points that count toward your final grade. Points are determined during a short interview about each lab with a member of the course staff. Note that you can submit your work for a lab more than once, for example, as you complete each part. After completing the work on some of the labs, you'll be presented with some on-line lab questions to answer (these are different than the tutorial questions mentioned above), and you'll need to schedule a short lab checkoff meeting for each lab with a member of the course staff. This meeting can happen after the lab's due date but to receive full credit it must be completed within one week of the due date.</p> <p>You must have a non-zero score for each required lab and all on-line lab questions must be checked-off as a prerequisite for passing the course. A missing required lab (i.e., a lab with a score of 0) will result in a failing grade; incompletes will not be given for unfinished laboratory work.</p> <p>The lab gets crowded just before an assignment is due so plan accordingly. The lab will be staffed by the course staff during the late afternoon and evening Monday through Thursday, and during the afternoon on Friday.</p> <p>Late policy for labs: The on-line system will give you 50% of any points earned for submissions after the due date. So if your first submittal is late, you get 50% of the points. But if you submitted on-time for 15 points, and then late for 25 points, you'll get 20 points total for the lab. Note that points reported by JSim/BSim at check-in are for on-time submittals; you can check your on-line status page to see how many points count toward your total. This will be reported as &quot;0&quot; until you complete your checkoff meeting.</p> <p>Late policy for checkoffs: The on-line system will allow only 50% of any points earned by your lab (including any late penalties you incurred) if you don't complete your checkoff before the checkoff deadline. So if you miss both the lab deadline and the checkoff deadline, you'll only get 25% of the total points.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Quizzes</h2> <p>There are five fifty-minute, closed-book quizzes. The questions will be similar (perhaps identical!) to the tutorial problems and will ask you to provide short, written answers and/or explanations. The quizzes are scheduled roughly every three weeks during recitation.</p> <p>To ensure everyone has a seat, please attend your assigned section on quiz days. If exceptional circumstances make it impossible to take a quiz at your assigned time, please contact your recitation instructor before the quiz to see if other arrangements can be made. Requests for make-ups after the quiz has been given are unlikely to be successful.</p> <p>There is no final exam.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Grading</h2> <p>The final grade is determined by performance on the quizzes (25 points/quiz, 125 points total), the labs, and the design project (75 points total). In addition, you must have a non-zero score for each of the required labs and all the on-line lab questions must be checked off as a prerequisite for passing the course. A missing required lab will result in a failing grade; incompletes will not be given for unfinished laboratory work.</p> <p>Once your combined score has been computed as explained above, here's how grades will be assigned:</p> <div class=\"maintabletemplate\"><table summary=\"See table caption for summary.\" class=\"tablewidth50\"> <caption class=\"invisible\">Grading criteria.</caption> <thead align=\"left\"> <tr> <th scope=\"col\">GRADES</th> <th scope=\"col\">REQUIREMENTS</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody align=\"left\"> <tr class=\"row\"> <td>A</td> <td>170 &lt;= total points</td> </tr> <tr class=\"alt-row\"> <td>B</td> <td>150 &lt;= total points &lt; 170</td> </tr> <tr class=\"row\"> <td>C</td> <td>130 &lt;= total points &lt; 150</td> </tr> <tr class=\"alt-row\"> <td>D</td> <td>110 &lt;= total points &lt; 130</td> </tr> <tr class=\"row\"> <td>F</td> <td>total points &lt; 110, missing required lab</td> </tr> </tbody> </table></div> <div class=\"help slide-bottom\"> <div class=\"help-message\"> <a class=\"help-engage\" href=\"javascript: trackEvents('Bottom Get Started','bottom get started Click','Help Overlay');\">Need help getting started?</a> <a href=\"javascript:disableHelpPopup(); trackEvents('Bottom Don\\'t Show','bottom don\\'t show Click','Help Overlay');\" class=\"help-dismiss\">Don't show me this again</a> </div> </div> <div class=\"help popup-center\"> <div class=\"help-message\"> <p class=\"help-dismiss\"><a href=\"javascript:disableHelpPopup(); trackEvents('Popup Don\\'t Show','popup don\\'t show Click','Help Overlay');\">Don't show me this again</a></p> <h2>Welcome!</h2> <p>This is one of over 2,200 courses on OCW.

Solutions submitted late will be noted as having been submitted, but there is no guarantee that they will be graded. This will depend on the availability and agreeably of the graders.</p> <p>We welcome collaboration, but we also want to know who you have worked with on the problem set, and we expect you to prepare the final solution individually and to hand in your own work. What you put down on paper must honestly reflect your effort and ability. If you have worked closely with other students to figure out solutions to a problem set, please so state at the end of the solution you submit; this will help us confirm that problem sets were not copied and protect you from being wrongly accused.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Tutorials</h2> <p>The Teaching Assistants will conduct one-hour tutorial sessions each week for small groups of students. Written problem set solutions will be distributed at the tutorial session immediately following the due date.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Exams</h2> <p>There will be two evening exams. These exams will be closed book, and you will be able to bring a 2-page, hand written crib sheet (to be handed in with your exam). You should also bring a calculator. There are no formal recitations on exam days, but your recitation instructors will be available in their offices to answer questions during your normal recitation hours. There will be a three-hour closed book final exam.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Design Problem</h2> <p>A special take-home exam problem on circuit design will be distributed after Ses #19; this assignment will be due a bit more than two weeks later. Late design problems will not receive full credit. Students must submit a satisfactory design problem solution to receive a grade in 6.012.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Grading</h2> <p>The following algorithm will be used to establish a score for you in 6.012: (1) two hour exams, 20% each; (2) final exam, 33%; (3) design problem, 15%; (4) problem sets, 12% total.</p> <p>This score will serve as a starting point for an assessment by the staff of your overall mastery of the subject matter. Your letter grade will also reflect your performance in recitations and tutorials, and will be the outcome of the total evaluation process.</p> <div class=\"help slide-bottom\"> <div class=\"help-message\"> <a class=\"help-engage\" href=\"javascript: trackEvents('Bottom Get Started','bottom get started Click','Help Overlay');\">Need help getting started?</a> <a href=\"javascript:disableHelpPopup(); trackEvents('Bottom Don\\'t Show','bottom don\\'t show Click','Help Overlay');\" class=\"help-dismiss\">Don't show me this again</a> </div> </div> <div class=\"help popup-center\"> <div class=\"help-message\"> <p class=\"help-dismiss\"><a href=\"javascript:disableHelpPopup(); trackEvents('Popup Don\\'t Show','popup don\\'t show Click','Help Overlay');\">Don't show me this again</a></p> <h2>Welcome!</h2> <p>This is one of over 2,200 courses on OCW.

Either or both types may be attended. Participation for at least one hour per week is important and is included in the homework grade.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Grading</h2> <p>The term grade G is approximately the sum Q1+Q2+2F+H where Q1+Q2 is the total quiz grade, F is the final exam grade, and H is the homework and tutorial grade; each is normalized to 100.

OCW does not provide access to this environment.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Course Meeting Times</h2> <p>Lectures: 2 sessions / week, 1 hour / session</p> <p>Recitations: 2 sessions / week, 1 hour / session</p> <p>Tutorials: 1 session / week, 1 hour / session</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Prerequisites</h2> <p>6.004 <em>Computation Structures</em></p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Course Description</h2> <p>This course covers topics on the engineering of computer software and hardware systems: techniques for controlling complexity; strong modularity using client-server design, virtual memory, and threads; networks; atomicity and coordination of parallel activities; recovery and reliability; privacy, security, and encryption; and impact of computer systems on society. Case studies of working systems and readings from the current literature provide comparisons and contrasts. Two design projects are required, and students engage in extensive written communication exercises.</p> <p>6.033 Frequently Asked Questions (<a href=\"/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-033-computer-system-engineering-spring-2009/syllabus/MIT6_033s09_syll01_faq.pdf\">PDF</a>)</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Grading Policy</h2> <p>You will receive two grades: one from the writing program (your writing grade) and one from the 6.033 staff (your 6.033 grade), which are combined in a final grade as follows.</p> <p>Your final grade is your 6.033 grade unless you received lower than a B for your writing grade. If you receive lower than a B, your final grade will be your 6.033 grade but dropped by one letter grade.</p> <p>Your 6.033 grade is based on three components: section evaluation, design projects, and quizzes. They are weighted as follows:</p> <div class=\"maintabletemplate\"><table summary=\"See table caption for summary.\" class=\"tablewidth50\"> <caption class=\"invisible\">Grading criteria.</caption> <thead align=\"left\"> <tr> <th scope=\"col\">ACTIVITIES</th> <th scope=\"col\">PERCENTAGES</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody align=\"left\"> <tr class=\"row\"> <td>Section evaluation</td> <td>25%</td> </tr> <tr class=\"alt-row\"> <td>Design projects</td> <td>35%</td> </tr> <tr class=\"row\"> <td>Quizzes</td> <td>40%</td> </tr> </tbody> </table></div> <p> </p><h3 class=\"subsubhead\">Section Evaluation</h3> <p>The section part of your grade reflects your overall level of participation in recitation and tutorial as well as a series of weekly hands-on projects that support recitation. Section instructors will base at least half of the evaluation on your communication skills: oral communication skills as observed in recitation paper discussions in class and written communication skills as evaluated by your instructor and your teaching assistant. The remainder of your section grade is based on the quality and enthusiasm of your participation, your understanding of the papers, and on whether you handed in the assignments, since the exercises aid your ability to discuss the papers.</p> <p>During most weeks, you will be expected to complete a hands-on experiment that requires a computer, usually an Athena workstation, and sometimes using the Web. The idea is to reinforce some of the abstract concepts from the lectures or papers that week and find out how things really work. These assignments generally do <strong>not</strong> require programming.</p> <h3 class=\"subsubhead\">Design Projects</h3> <p>The final result of each of the two design projects will be an extended paper in which you describe a detailed system design to solve a real-world problem. There will be two design projects, each of which will extend over roughly half the semester. The first will be an individual project; the second will be done in teams of three students from the same recitation.</p> <p>The first design paper will be forwarded to the Communication Program and graded on writing, as described in the section on writing requirements.</p> <p>One of the teaching assistants' primary roles is to tie the design projects into the topics covered in lectures and recitations. On most Fridays, they will be teaching &quot;tutorials&quot; to explain the design projects' requirements and some of the tradeoffs inherent in the projects. Like lectures and recitations, these tutorials are mandatory. Students are also welcome to ask questions about the design projects during TA office hours.</p> <p>A couple of weeks into each design project, you'll be asked to hand in a short design proposal. We'll evaluate this to make sure you're on the right track and to suggest writing improvements, but it will only count against the project grade if you fail to hand it in. We'll also discuss common mistakes during tutorial. Both design project proposals will be forwarded to the writing program, and be graded according to the description in the writing requirements section.</p> <h3 class=\"subsubhead\">Quizzes</h3> <p>Two quizzes are held during the term. A third quiz (1.5 hours in length) will be scheduled during finals week. Each quiz will focus on a third of the class's material, but keep in mind that later topics in 6.033 build heavily upon the earlier topics. The quizzes count as follows: 12.5% quiz 1, 12.5% quiz 2, and 15% quiz 3.</p> <h3 class=\"subsubhead\">Non-Linearities</h3> <p>Please note well: Although the formula to calculate your final 6.033 grade appears to be linear, there are some important non-linearities in the calculation. These non-linearities are the three ways in which you can be sure of getting an F in 6.033:</p> <ol> <li>Traditional method (which actually is the result of the linear formula mentioned above): Provide convincing evidence, in the form of exceptionally low or missing grades on quizzes and other assignments, that you have gotten little or nothing out of the subject. Note that if you don't regularly attend recitation and tutorial, you will receive an F for the section evaluation, even if you have faithfully handed in the assignments.</li> <li>Fail to turn in Design Project 1 by the last day of class.</li> <li>Fail to turn in Design Project 2 by the last day of class.</li> </ol> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Collaboration</h2> <p>Our policy is simple, based on professional standards: on quizzes you should not collaborate. On all other assignments you are welcome to work with anyone else on ideas and understanding, but your writing should be your own and you should <strong>carefully acknowledge all contributions of ideas by others</strong>, whether from classmates or from papers you have read.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Communication Intensive Recitations</h2> <p><strong>MIT faculty and department members believe that students in any field should learn to write prose that is clear, organized, and eloquent, and to marshal facts and ideas into convincing written and oral presentations.</strong></p> <p>MIT implemented the Communication Requirement in 2000 in response to alumni feedback. Alumni said that they had received an outstanding technical education at MIT but needed more training in writing and speaking to succeed in their professional careers.</p> <p>The 6.033 faculty have worked with the MIT Writing Across the Curriculum (WAC) program for more than 10 years to design 6.033 writing and speaking assignments. We have chosen assignments that are similar to the kinds of writing you will do in the engineering workplace: memos, proposals, design reports, and design presentations.</p> <p>To assist you in preparing for the written assignments, several of the Friday tutorials will focus on communication instruction. At these recitations, you will receive advice on how to write your one-page assignments, Design Project 1 proposal, and Design Project 1 from a Writing Recitation instructor. Attendance to the writing recitations will be included in your final overall recitation grade.</p> <h3 class=\"subsubhead\">Your 6.033 CI Grade</h3> <p>Your Writing Recitation instructor will comment on and grade four of your written assignments:</p> <ul> <li>Therac-25 written assignment (one-pager 1)</li> <li>X-windows written assignment (one-pager 2)</li> <li>Design proposal for Design Project 1 (DP1 proposal)</li> <li>Design Project 1 (DP1)</li> </ul> <p>The grades assigned by the writing program will follow <a href=\"/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-033-computer-system-engineering-spring-2009/syllabus/writingprogram\">the descriptions given here</a>.</p> <p>The Therac-25 writing grade will not be factored into the average for the writing component of your grade. Your 6.033 writing grade will be calculated as follows:</p> <div class=\"maintabletemplate\"><table summary=\"See table caption for summary.\" class=\"tablewidth75\"> <caption class=\"invisible\">Grading criteria.</caption> <thead align=\"left\"> <tr> <th scope=\"col\">ACTIVITIES</th> <th scope=\"col\">PERCENTAGES</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody align=\"left\"> <tr class=\"row\"> <td>Attendance (writing sessions, appointments)</td> <td>20%</td> </tr> <tr class=\"alt-row\"> <td>Therac-25 paper (one-pager 1)</td> <td>Grade noted, but not calculated in average</td> </tr> <tr class=\"row\"> <td>X-Windows paper (one-pager 2)</td> <td>20%</td> </tr> <tr class=\"alt-row\"> <td>DP1 proposal</td> <td>20%</td> </tr> <tr class=\"row\"> <td>DP1 full paper</td> <td>40%</td> </tr> </tbody> </table></div> <p> </p><p>If your average writing grade is below a B, your final grade for 6.033 will be reduced by 1 letter grade.</p> <p>With permission of your Writing Recitation instructor, you may revise your assignments to improve your grade.

Each problem set will include 3-5 problems for all students and one problem for graduate students only. The problem sets will include both theoretical and programming problems. For programming problems, we will provide skeleton code in Python, but you may use a different programming language if you so choose.</p> <h3 class=\"subsubhead\">Midterm Exam</h3> <p>There will be a midterm exam approximately halfway through the course, which will cover all material up until that point. There will be no final exam.</p> <h3 class=\"subsubhead\">Final Project</h3> <p>You will complete a final project during the second half of the semester. You may either work alone or with one partner. Teams and graduate students will be expected to undertake more ambitious projects. In previous years, approaches to the final project have included:</p> <ul> <li>Compare several computational biology algorithms for solving the same problem, by implementing them, applying them to some dataset, and evaluating the results.</li> <li>Design and apply a novel computational biology algorithm and evaluate its performance and effectiveness.</li> <li>Carefully analyze, with criticism, corrections and/or improvements, a relevant conference or journal article.</li> </ul> <p>We will distribute more detailed project expectations and suggested project topics as the term progresses.</p> <h3 class=\"subsubhead\">Scribing</h3> <p>Each student will be required to scribe for one lecture. Several students may be assigned to work together on each lecture, depending on course enrollment. You are encouraged but not required to use LaTeX for scribe notes.</p> <p>As a scribe, you should strive to produce a self-contained narrative of the lecture. The slides for each lecture will be available, so you should pay particular attention to issues that the slides don't convey well on their own. For example: what is the background and motivation for the problem we are studying? What were some particularly insightful questions and answers that we discussed? Were there any common misunderstandings or points of confusion? How about alternative ways of explaining a concept or algorithm? Did we stumble upon any good ideas for a final project?</p> <p>You can of course use the scribe notes from previous years and improve upon them, and the LaTeX source will be made available to the students scribing each lecture by the TAs.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Recitations</h2> <p>A weekly recitation will be held on Fridays, during which we will discuss additional aspects of the lecture material and hold Q&amp;A.</p> <div class=\"help slide-bottom\"> <div class=\"help-message\"> <a class=\"help-engage\" href=\"javascript: trackEvents('Bottom Get Started','bottom get started Click','Help Overlay');\">Need help getting started?</a> <a href=\"javascript:disableHelpPopup(); trackEvents('Bottom Don\\'t Show','bottom don\\'t show Click','Help Overlay');\" class=\"help-dismiss\">Don't show me this again</a> </div> </div> <div class=\"help popup-center\"> <div class=\"help-message\"> <p class=\"help-dismiss\"><a href=\"javascript:disableHelpPopup(); trackEvents('Popup Don\\'t Show','popup don\\'t show Click','Help Overlay');\">Don't show me this again</a></p> <h2>Welcome!</h2> <p>This is one of over 2,200 courses on OCW.

This subject covers diodes, transistors, JFETs, op-amps, and basic analog circuit design as applied to audio and radio frequency circuits. Students spend the second half of the term designing their own projects. Projects vary in scope and breadth, depending on students' level of prior background and interest. Past projects have ranged from simple power amplifiers to advanced noise canceling headphones.</p> <p>6.101 aims to minimize math and emphasize visual and intuitive circuit understanding, to create a practical and useful design experience. In the process, students will learn to understand and use a wide variety of analog circuits. They will learn how to use books and periodicals to find circuit ideas and to supplement their textbook knowledge. Past final projects have included:</p> <ul> <li>Theremin (an electronic instrument that produces sounds based on how far the user's hands are from a pair of metal rods)</li> <li>Audio mixer, effects engine, Dolby decoder, and multi-channel power amplifiers</li> <li>Noise cancelling headphones</li> <li>Beat detector and note finder</li> <li>FM modulated transmission over a power line</li> <li>Laser link audio transmitter and receiver</li> <li>400W class D full range audio amplifier</li> <li>Analog computer</li> </ul> <p>The laboratory satisfies either the institute laboratory requirement or the course 6 laboratory requirement. It gives 12 Engineering Design Points. Passable performance in 6.002 or 6.071 should provide sufficient background. However, students often find it valuable to have taken more advanced circuit design classes, as they allow for more ambitious (and more interesting) final projects.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Textbooks</h2> <p><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/007328596X/ref=nosim/mitopencourse-20\"><img alt=\"Buy at Amazon\" src=\"/images/a_logo_17.gif\" align=\"absMiddle\" border=\"0\" /></a> Neamen, Donald. <em>Microelectronic Circuit Analysis and Design</em>. 3rd ed.

Upper Saddle River, NJ: Prentice Hall, 2003. ISBN: 9780130449115.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Component Pinouts/Data</h2> <p>Pinouts for most components are easily available through the Web (e.g., do a Googleâ¢ search to locate the appropriate data sheet). Relevant sheets needed for the labs are available in <a href=\"/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-111-introductory-digital-systems-laboratory-spring-2006/labs\">labs</a> section.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Conduct of the Subject</h2> <h3 class=\"subsubhead\">Classes</h3> <p>In the first couple of weeks of the term, there will be lectures on Friday (to quickly ramp up on material needed for lab 1). Then, Fridays will be used for recitations (three parallel recitation sections). Lectures and recitations are discontinued at the end of the term so you can focus on the final project (see course schedule for details). We will meet in the lecture hall for project group presentations after the block diagram conferences.</p> <h3 class=\"subsubhead\">Laboratory Assignments</h3> <p>All laboratory exercises must be completed; these are intended to prepare you for the term project. In doing these exercises, each student works individually. We strongly recommend that you use a computer-based drawing package to draw block diagrams and schematics for the lab reports and final project.</p> <h3 class=\"subsubhead\">Problem Sets</h3> <p>Three problem sets will be issued. The problem sets will emphasize the material covered in lectures and recitations and the primary goal is to help you prepare for the labs.</p> <h3 class=\"subsubhead\">Quiz</h3> <p>There will be one quiz during the term before Drop Date.</p> <h3 class=\"subsubhead\">Term Project</h3> <p>The most important assignment is the Term Project, about which you will receive more detailed instruction later. In doing this assignment, you will work with one or, at most, two partners. You should begin finding your partner(s) early in the term.</p> <h3 class=\"subsubhead\">Grading Policy</h3> <p>The Lab 1 checkoff sheet is to be initialed by a TA or LA and included with your report. Note that the checkoff sheet is <strong>not</strong> the report. Lab 1 report template is available in the <a href=\"/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-111-introductory-digital-systems-laboratory-spring-2006/labs\">labs</a> section.</p> <p>Lab 2 report will be used for part of the CIM requirement. More details will be provided in lecture.</p> <p>Lab 3 will only include the checkoff. There is no need to write a detailed lab report for lab 3. The lab will have instructions on what is to be turned in.</p> <p>Lab 4 has an intermediate checkoff (not graded) and the final checkoff. There is virtually no modification required to a report depending on the working of your lab implementation. However, reports with no lab effort will receive a zero.</p> <p>The term project requirements <strong>must</strong> be completed in accordance with the schedule given in the instructions. You must make a presentation of your part of your project to the rest of the class after the logic diagram conference. You must demonstrate (i.e., present) your term project even if it does not fully function, and you must submit the written report in order to receive a passing grade.</p> <p>An approximate breakdown for final grades is as follows:</p> <div class=\"maintabletemplate\"> <table class=\"tablewidth50\" summary=\"See table caption for summary.\"> <caption class=\"invisible\">Grading criteria.</caption> <thead align=\"left\"> <tr> <th scope=\"col\">ACTIVITIES</th> <th scope=\"col\">PERCENTAGES</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody align=\"left\"> <tr class=\"row\"> <td>Quiz</td> <td>10%</td> </tr> <tr class=\"alt-row\"> <td>Three problem sets</td> <td>3%</td> </tr> <tr class=\"row\"> <td>Lab 1</td> <td>9%</td> </tr> <tr class=\"alt-row\"> <td>Lab 2</td> <td>10%</td> </tr> <tr class=\"row\"> <td>Lab 3</td> <td>7%</td> </tr> <tr class=\"alt-row\"> <td>Lab 4</td> <td>11%</td> </tr> <tr class=\"row\"> <td>Writing (Lab 2 revision - part of CIM requirement)</td> <td>10%</td> </tr> <tr class=\"alt-row\"> <td>Participation (Lecture, recitation, project presentations)</td> <td>3%</td> </tr> <tr class=\"row\"> <td>Final project</td> <td>37%</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> </div> <br /> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Late Penalties</h2> <p>Late work will be penalized. Lateness of the lab assignments will result in a 20% per day penalty for work completed 1-5 working days after the due date. No point credit will be given for unexcused lateness exceeding 5 days. The final project <strong>must</strong> be done on time.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Collaboration</h2> <p>You may discuss labs with anyone (staff, former students, other students, etc.), but then do the work on them individually. Do not copy anything, including computer files, from anyone else.</p> <p>Collaboration with your partners on the project is desirable. Project reports should be joint with individual authors specified for each section. You may copy anything you want, with appropriate attribution, for your project report.</p> <div class=\"help slide-bottom\"> <div class=\"help-message\"> <a class=\"help-engage\" href=\"javascript: trackEvents('Bottom Get Started','bottom get started Click','Help Overlay');\">Need help getting started?</a> <a href=\"javascript:disableHelpPopup(); trackEvents('Bottom Don\\'t Show','bottom don\\'t show Click','Help Overlay');\" class=\"help-dismiss\">Don't show me this again</a> </div> </div> <div class=\"help popup-center\"> <div class=\"help-message\"> <p class=\"help-dismiss\"><a href=\"javascript:disableHelpPopup(); trackEvents('Popup Don\\'t Show','popup don\\'t show Click','Help Overlay');\">Don't show me this again</a></p> <h2>Welcome!</h2> <p>This is one of over 2,200 courses on OCW.

This course covers a wide range of topics, including: polarization properties of light, reflection and refraction, coherence and interference, Fraunhofer and Fresnel diffraction, holography, imaging and transforming properties of lenses, spatial filtering, two-lens coherent optical processor, optical properties of materials, lasers, electro-optic, acousto-optic and liquid-crystal light modulators, optical detectors, optical waveguides and fiber-optic communication systems.</p><p>Most optical systems involve the use of many of the principles and components we will study. The goal is to help the student develop a thorough understanding of the underlying physical principles of modern optical devices and systems through hands-on learning. Lectures are supplemented with weekly laboratory exercises, problem sets and a final laboratory project of the student's choosing. There are 12 design points associated with this subject. Students may use this subject to find an advanced undergraduate project.</p><p>There are two lectures and one laboratory period each week for the first eight weeks. During the first several weeks, the lectures will review and develop fundamental principles and concepts in classical optics, and optical and quantum electronics. The remaining lectures address contemporary topics in modern optics.</p><p>Since this is a laboratory course, the intent is not to dwell on detailed theoretical treatments of the topics, but to provide a sufficient background for the student to grasp the principles and confirm the associated phenomena in the laboratory. For more theoretical treatments the student is encouraged to enroll in other optics subjects that are specifically designed for this purpose (e.g., <a href=\"/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-630-electromagnetics-fall-2006/index.htm\">6.630</a>, 6.631, 6.634, and 6.637).</p><h2 class=\"subhead\">Prerequisites</h2><p>The prerequisite is <a href=\"/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-003-signals-and-systems-fall-2011\">6.003</a>. Exceptions can be made by the Lecturer.</p><h2 class=\"subhead\">Course Content</h2><h3 class=\"subsubhead\">Laboratory Exercises</h3><p>There are seven short laboratory exercises concerned with the measurement and observation of basic optical and quantum phenomena. Each laboratory exercise consists of pre-lab exercises (to be completed before entering the lab) and several experiments dealing with the same theme, designed to complement the lecture material. Each laboratory exercise will be set up by the course staff for one week only, and you must complete each laboratory exercise sometime during the week that it is set up.</p><p>Some of the laboratory exercises require a considerable amount of setup time, and once they have been taken apart, they will not be set up again. Laboratory exercise reports must be turned in to the Teaching Assistant (TA) one week after the exercise was scheduled. In the event the report is due on a day when the Institute is closed, the report should be turned in to the TA by 5:00 pm on the first day that classes resume whether or not the Laboratory is open on that day. This may be a day when 6.161 does not meet.</p><p>Late homework should be placed in the bin outside the professor's office or handed directly to the TA. All laboratory write-ups (along with pre-lab exercises) <strong>must</strong> be done in a carbonless-copy lab notebook. Currently, we will only accept lab write-ups using the Hayden McNeil Physical Sciences Student Lab Notebook with Spiral Binding. There is also a spiral-bound Chemical Sciences version of this notebook, which is acceptable. Students must turn in the yellow copies and keep the blue copies for themselves and for reference. Blue copies are <strong>never</strong> to be removed from the lab notebook. Plots, tables and graphs must be pasted onto both the blue and yellow copy. More information as to laboratory write-up specifics is available in the <a href=\"/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-161-modern-optics-project-laboratory-fall-2005/labs\">labs</a> section.</p><h3 class=\"subsubhead\">Homework Problems</h3><p>The homework problems are designed to encourage outside reading, and to strengthen your grasp of the fundamentals. One homework problem set will be handed out each week and will be due one week later. Problem sets will not be accepted after the solutions are handed out. Points will be deducted for late problem sets.</p><h3 class=\"subsubhead\">Quizzes</h3><p>There will be two quizzes during the term. The quizzes will be given during the regular 1.5 hour class. These quizzes will cover broad ideas, as presented in lecture, lab, and homework. They will test your understanding of the fundamentals and their applications. These quizzes will be open class notes (Prof. Warde's course notes). You should not stress over these quizzes. If you have done the reading, attended lecture, completed the homework, and worked the labs, you should have no problem with the quizzes. The quizzes will consist of short questions intended to test your knowledge of basic optical principles and laboratory optics. The quizzes will count for approximately 20% of your grade (10% each). These quizzes will enable the teaching staff to diagnose both our teaching and your comprehension. Quizzes, like homework may be a determining factor if your grade is borderline.</p><h3 class=\"subsubhead\">Final Project</h3><p>To make all the Final Projects roughly equal in difficulty and time requirement, we will provide you with several possible Final Projects (which will still allow for, and require, innovation). Additionally, we will allow students to start on the Final Project as soon as they want... hopefully reducing end-of-the-term stress. We will provide the necessary lab equipment and all the technical help we can to ensure that your experience is both educational and rewarding. Of course, if you still want to find your own project, or have a hankering to do something different, just tell us, and we will try to accommodate you (in such a case, we would encourage you to look around MIT for groups that may have projects that interest you). Many final projects found outside of class turn into RAships and M.Eng. work.</p><p>The written report for the final project should be on the order of 15 to 30 pages in length (please, no longer... you should be able to condense any relevant prose into that space). Additional information is available in the projects section.</p><h2 class=\"subhead\">General Policies</h2><p>To make laboratory exercises flow smoothly, please arrive on time for your assigned lab sessions. Additionally, please come prepared: this means that you will have:</p><ol><li>read the lab material before arriving,</li><li>completed the pre-lab, and</li><li>brought your questions with you.</li></ol><p>As part of the pre-lab, you must find and review the equations necessary to complete the lab before you begin. In order to ensure that you will have all the data you need for your write-ups, you will be required to take notes in a laboratory notebook (Hayden McNeil Physical Sciences Spiral Bound Student Lab Notebook). These notebooks may be checked at any time by the TA or professor to make sure they contain all necessary information. A well-kept notebook will help ensure that you not fail to gather all the necessary data for your write-up (as you may not be able to come back and retrieve the data before the apparatus for a given laboratory exercise is dismantled). Additionally, short oral quizzes may be given in lab to test your comprehension of the current laboratory material - these quizzes or notebook checks will count toward your laboratory grade (between 5% and 10% depending on difficulty).</p><h3 class=\"subsubhead\">Grading</h3><p>The laboratory exercises are an integral part of 6.161, constitute the majority of your learning, and thus the final grade. Each homework problem set makes up a small, but non-negligible portion of the final grade. The two quizzes are obviously very important since they represent 20% of the grade. Your performance on the Final Project is also a very important portion of our evaluation of your overall performance. The approximate percentage values are as follows:</p><div class=\"maintabletemplate\"><table summary=\"See table caption for summary.\" class=\"tablewidth50\"><caption class=\"invisible\">Grading criteria.</caption><thead align=\"left\"><tr><th scope=\"col\">ACTIVITIES</th><th scope=\"col\">PERCENTAGES</th></tr></thead><tbody align=\"left\"><tr class=\"row\"><td>Labs (Active participation in lab, performance on pre-lab, and good laboratory notes will form a significant portion of this grade)</td><td>40%</td></tr><tr class=\"alt-row\"><td>Homework</td><td>20%</td></tr><tr class=\"row\"><td>In-class Quizzes and In-class Participation</td><td>20%</td></tr><tr class=\"alt-row\"><td>Final Project</td><td>20%</td></tr></tbody></table></div><p><br /> </p><p>We will take into account participation in-class and in-lab as well as attendance when deciding borderline final grades.</p><p>Please note: To earn a passing grade (A,B,C) in this subject, you must complete and write up all seven of the Laboratory Exercises in the prescribed time period. Thus, at the end of the term no incompletes will be given due to incomplete final projects!</p><p>Also, since most students do well on both the labs and the Final Project, performance on both the problems sets and quizzes become an extremely important factor in determining the final grades.</p><h3 class=\"subsubhead\">Grading Breakdown</h3><p>All homework problem sets account for the same number of points (re-normalized at the end of the term). How you got to your answer is very important. Show your work! The grader will deduct points for answers which lack justification. The worth of each Laboratory Exercise is based on the length and difficulty of the lab (e.g. Lab 3 counts for more than Lab. 1). For all labs, write your answers in your lab notebooks. Be sure to include derivations, solutions, graphs, diagrams, data, and physical explanation when answering the lab questions. Be sure to include copies of any computer print-outs on both the normal sheet and the second carbonless copy sheet.</p><p><strong>Note from the TA</strong>: Please do not become discouraged if your score on the first lab seems low. Lab 1, while it does count as part of the final grade, should be viewed as a steppingstone into the course. Just do the best you can on this Lab. Assume nothing, and be very thorough! Do not assume that the grader knows how you arrived at your answers. Assume the grader has never taken this class, and thus needs a full and detailed explanation. While you may have the correct answer, how you got there is more important! You will not receive credit for answers without explanation.) The TA will only grade your lab report if you showed up to lab and actively participated in the lab experiments.</p><h3 class=\"subsubhead\">Neatness and Clarity</h3><p>To ensure that you get the maximum number of points on each Lab and homework assignment, make sure to be neat! The TA or grader will not grade messy work. Additionally, messy work will delay turnaround on both problem sets and homework. Questions on both problems sets and labs must be answered clearly and succinctly. The TA will be looking for demonstrated understanding. It is preferred that you explain in words when possible; this will ensure that you get the maximum number of points for your effort. However, do not neglect mathematical rigor. When math is needed, it must have the proper units and be clearly written. The TA and a grader grade all labs and homework; the more clear and succinct your answers, the better. However, do not compromise important details. The grader will not accept numerical answers without their derivation. Likewise, the grader will not accept written answers, without appropriate reasoning.</p><h3 class=\"subsubhead\">Labeling and Formatting</h3><p>Whenever a problem asks for a graph, the student must create computer-generated graphs. All graphs must be labeled and titled - a copy of the graph must exist both on the blue and yellow carbonless-copy sheets of your lab notebook. Use callouts to point out important regions of your graphs. Any written answers exceeding one page must be typed. It is suggested that you format all your answers using LaTeX or a comparable typesetting package. If you wish to use one of your labs for the Writing Requirement, notify the TA beforehand.</p><p>Label your answers clearly; the grader will not search extensively for an answer. Circle your answers, and underline key portions of your work which directly aid in the creation of the answer. Points may not be given back if an answer is skipped in the grading process because the answer was difficult to find.</p><h3 class=\"subsubhead\">MATLABÂ®, MathematicaÂ®, LabView and MapleÂ®</h3><p>When computer-based problems are presented, please use MATLABÂ®, MathematicaÂ®, LabView or MapleÂ® to do your work. If you feel much more comfortable with other math packages, that is okay, but please put the code in your public directory along with instructions on its execution. Please include any code and graphs you use in your solutions. Often, unless stated, graphical solutions may be used, especially if they show that you really understand the material. To use MATLABÂ®, MathematicaÂ® or MapleÂ® on the MIT server, type: add MATLABÂ®, add math, and add mapleÂ® at the server prompt. These software packages can also be found on the lab machines.</p><h3 class=\"subsubhead\">Late-Work Policy</h3><p>Having been an undergraduate once, your TA knows that many of you have obligations which inhibit your ability (on rare occasions) to turn in work on time. If such an emergency arises, notify the TA before the homework is due (if possible). In order to be fair to your classmates, we must still penalize late work (unless the tardiness was due to medical or similarly urgent reasons). Additionally, an incomplete problem set will not be accepted. We expect you to make an effort on <strong>all</strong> parts of <strong>all</strong> problems. This gives us the chance to see where you are having problems, if any. If you need additional time, ask for it. You will always receive more points for a completed late problem set than an on-time incomplete one (assuming you turn it in before solutions are handed out). If tardiness becomes a chronic problem, it will significantly degrade our final evaluation of your performance.</p><h3 class=\"subsubhead\">Collaboration</h3><p>Collaboration is encouraged. Talking with peers about problems helps everyone (&quot;To teach is to learn twice.&quot; - Joseph Joubert). However, blatant copying and other forms of cheating will not be tolerated. Always acknowledge your collaborators. In no way can this hurt your grade (in fact, it may help). We care that you learn the material - if you learn it best from a friend, that's fine.</p><p>Questions regarding problem sets and labs should be addressed to the class collaboration webpage. So collaboration (online) must be done through the moderated collaboration Web page. That way everyone has access to the same resources; and if you have a problem or question, someone may be able to help you - including the TA. There you can get help from the Lab staff, as well as your peers.</p><h3 class=\"subsubhead\">Office Hours</h3><p>Office Hours will be conducted weekly, by appointment. Office hours will address questions from the laboratory exercises, quizzes, and problem sets. Office hours may also include hands-on demonstrations of applied concepts. While office hours are not mandatory, they may cover concepts and material that may show up on quizzes, homework and labs. Students are expected to ask questions and come to office hours prepared. Questions and concerns addressed on the class electronic mailing list, as well as the class collaboration page may be addressed in office hours.</p> <div class=\"help slide-bottom\"> <div class=\"help-message\"> <a class=\"help-engage\" href=\"javascript: trackEvents('Bottom Get Started','bottom get started Click','Help Overlay');\">Need help getting started?</a> <a href=\"javascript:disableHelpPopup(); trackEvents('Bottom Don\\'t Show','bottom don\\'t show Click','Help Overlay');\" class=\"help-dismiss\">Don't show me this again</a> </div> </div> <div class=\"help popup-center\"> <div class=\"help-message\"> <p class=\"help-dismiss\"><a href=\"javascript:disableHelpPopup(); trackEvents('Popup Don\\'t Show','popup don\\'t show Click','Help Overlay');\">Don't show me this again</a></p> <h2>Welcome!</h2> <p>This is one of over 2,200 courses on OCW.

In addition to teaching these techniques, the course provides students with experience working in a laboratory and teaches good work habits and techniques for approaching laboratory work. A major purpose of 6.163 is to provide students with many opportunities to sharpen their communication skills: oral, written, and visual.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Do I Need to Know Photography?</h2> <p>Black and white photography will play an important role in the course. No prior knowledge of photography is assumed - all necessary techniques will be taught at the beginning of the semester.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">What About the Labs and the Final Project?</h2> <p>Students will be assigned to lab groups of 4 students each. Each lab will meet once a week for three hours. Students will need additional time to complete their darkroom work. During the first six weeks, each group will complete 6 setpiece laboratories. Then each group will spend two weeks planning and executing the &quot;Mark 1&quot; version of their final project (a project of the group's own design). For the remainder of the term, laboratory time will be spent executing these final projects.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">How are the Lectures Structured?</h2> <p>For the first six weeks, the lectures will provide the detailed technical information required to carry out the laboratory exercises and to prepare students for their final project. The next two to three weeks, the lectures will provide an overview of past final projects, as well as presenting many different imaging techniques that may be of use in planning final projects. For the remainder of the term, the lectures will review on various applications of strobes.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Grading and Course Expectations</h2> <h3 class=\"subsubhead\">General Statement</h3> <p>The point of this course is to provide students with experience in doing and thinking about experimental laboratory work. To achieve this, each student must become actively involved in laboratories and projects. Since you will be working in groups there will always be the possibility that some students will pick up points quicker, be more forceful with their opinions, or in some way tend to lead or dominate the group. It is the responsibility of each student to ensure that they are participating in and benefiting from course activities.</p> <p>This is also a subject about communication: oral, written and visual. You will be expected to make several brief presentations in class regarding the previous week's lab or your group's project.</p> <h3 class=\"subsubhead\">Grading</h3> <p>The general distribution of grading between labs, quizzes, problem sets, etc. is shown below. Grading for the course is part objective, part subjective. The objective part is simply the numerical grade you receive for any given item. The subjective part arises from how the staff perceives your involvement with the course - attendance, active participation in labs and project, preparation for labs, etc.</p> <p>All assigned work must be submitted in order to receive a grade.</p> <div class=\"maintabletemplate\"> <table class=\"tablewidth50\" summary=\"See table caption for summary.\"> <caption class=\"invisible\">Course grades.</caption> <thead align=\"left\"> <tr> <th scope=\"col\">ACTIVITIES</th> <th scope=\"col\">PERCENTAGES</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody align=\"left\"> <tr class=\"row\"> <td>Laboratory Work and Reports</td> <td>30%</td> </tr> <tr class=\"alt-row\"> <td>Problem Sets, In-class Work, and Practical Exercise</td> <td>10%</td> </tr> <tr class=\"row\"> <td>Quiz</td> <td>10%</td> </tr> <tr class=\"alt-row\"> <td>Mark I Progress Reports and Mark I Project Work</td> <td>15%</td> </tr> <tr class=\"row\"> <td>Final Project Work and Final Report</td> <td>35%</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> </div> <p>Each student must have a bound laboratory notebook and use it to record all lab work. Weekly lab reports are due at the following week's lab session. Each lab is worth six percentage points. Late reports will lose 1 percentage point per day. Each student may have one no-penalty extension during the term, applicable to any of the first six labs. Weekly lab reports are an individual effort.</p> <p>The Mark I project closes with a 15-minute-long group presentation and a written report from your group. The Final Project closes with a final 15-minute-long group presentation of the project in the last week of class, and a written report that is due on the last day of classes. The Mark I and Final Project reports and presentations are group efforts.</p> <p>Again, all assigned work must be handed in to receive a grade.</p> <h3 class=\"subsubhead\">Lectures</h3> <p>Regular attendance is expected. There is a lot of material in the lectures you might consider extraneous. They are designed to give you the background material relevant to the laboratory exercises or to further your understanding of experimental techniques or applications. There will be occasional guest speakers. Out of simple courtesy, full attendance is expected.</p> <h3 class=\"subsubhead\">Quizzes</h3> <p>There is one in-class quiz about midway through the term. The quiz will cover basic knowledge of photography and strobe illumination. It will also test your ability to apply that knowledge in new situations.</p> <h3 class=\"subsubhead\">Laboratory Work</h3> <p>It is mandatory that you show up at your regularly scheduled lab time so that you have ongoing interaction with the course staff. Arrive at these lab sessions with a brief written plan in your lab notebook of what you intend to work on or accomplish in that lab period. Your TA will collect the carbon copy of that plan.</p> <h3 class=\"subsubhead\">Final Projects</h3> <p>Mark I and Project Written Reports and In-class Oral Presentation</p> <ul> <li>These are intended to be joint efforts, with all members of the lab group receiving the same numerical grade for both the report and the presentation. A subjective assessment for individual effort will be made by the course staff. In a few cases, lab groups have had problems in sharing effort fairly and amicably. If there is any anticipation that this might be a problem, we request that the group make a clear written delineation of responsibilities for the various parts of the project so that individual efforts can be properly assessed.</li> </ul> <p>Laboratory Work for Final Project</p> <ul> <li>It is not expected that you will be able to complete the project using only your regularly scheduled lab times. Since the laboratory resources will be needed at off hours (nights, weekends) by all groups there will be a need for mutual cooperation and courtesy between lab groups. If staff assistance is needed at odd hours, you must arrange for the help ahead of time. </li> </ul> <div class=\"help slide-bottom\"> <div class=\"help-message\"> <a class=\"help-engage\" href=\"javascript: trackEvents('Bottom Get Started','bottom get started Click','Help Overlay');\">Need help getting started?</a> <a href=\"javascript:disableHelpPopup(); trackEvents('Bottom Don\\'t Show','bottom don\\'t show Click','Help Overlay');\" class=\"help-dismiss\">Don't show me this again</a> </div> </div> <div class=\"help popup-center\"> <div class=\"help-message\"> <p class=\"help-dismiss\"><a href=\"javascript:disableHelpPopup(); trackEvents('Popup Don\\'t Show','popup don\\'t show Click','Help Overlay');\">Don't show me this again</a></p> <h2>Welcome!</h2> <p>This is one of over 2,200 courses on OCW.

A <a href=\"#Calendar\">calendar</a> of topics is presented below.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Purpose</h2> <p>6.xxx is designed to help you learn about progress toward the scientific goal of understanding human intelligence from a computational point of view. The foundations for 6.xxx were developed by a group that styles itself as <a href=\"http://genesis.csail.mit.edu/HIE/\">The Human Intelligence Enterprise</a>, from which this subject draws its name.</p> <p>6.xxx complements <a href=\"/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-034-artificial-intelligence-fall-2010\">6.034</a>, because 6.xxx focuses on long-standing scientific questions, whereas 6.034 focuses on existing tools for building applications with reasoning and learning capability.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Why You Should Take 6.xxx</h2> <ul> <li>You should take 6.xxx if you want to learn about the enterprise of explaining intelligence from a computational point of view. When you have finished the subject, you will understand the powerful ideas behind an optimistic view of what will be discovered in the next decade.</li> <li>You should take 6.xxx if you want to develop a foundation for making personal contributions toward reaching the goal of understanding intelligence. When you have finished the subject, you will know about intriguing ideas begging for extension.</li> <li>You should take 6.xxx if you want to learn how to dig the salient ideas out of a research paper without distraction by minutiae. When you have finished the subject, you will have learned to identify big ideas and ignore detritus.</li> <li>You should take 6.xxx if you want to learn to present complex ideas effectively, as if you were presenting a thesis, delivering a job talk, chatting with a high-ranking official at breakfast, or making a presentation to a potential customer or venture capitalist. When you have finished the subject, you will have learned about heuristics that will improve your ability to do all these.</li> </ul> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Why 6.xxx can be Viewed as a Humanities Subject</h2> <ul> <li>6.xxx is about computational theories of human thinking. Hence, 6.xxx can be viewed as a special kind of psychology subject.</li> <li>6.xxx is about ferreting big ideas out of original sources through thoughtful reading, writing, and discussion. Hence, 6.xxx can be viewed as a special kind of literature subject.</li> <li>6.xxx is about packaging ideas into a variety of formats, including abstracts, conclusions, slide shows, press releases, proposals, reports, letters, and conversation. Hence, 6.xxx can be viewed as a subject in communication.</li> <li>6.xxx is about how to empower ideas through a clear statement of vision, an enumeration of concrete steps toward the vision, an articulation of new results with clarifying details, and a statement of contributions. Hence, 6.xxx can be viewed as a subject in persuasion and leadership.</li> </ul> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Why You Should Avoid 6.xxx</h2> <ul> <li>You should avoid 6.xxx unless you can commit to on-time attendance and committed reading.</li> </ul> <p>Because of the emphasis on reading and discussion, and the limitation on enrollment, regular attendance is obligatory, along with commitment to reading the papers. If you cannot picture yourself in class at 9:30 am, every Monday and Wednesday, you should not register, so as to make room for others who would otherwise be excluded because of the enrollment limitation. A corollary is that you probably should not register for 6.xxx if you are taking five subjects or course equivalents, such as UROP. You definitely should not register if you are involved in a startup or you are taking six or more subjects or subject equivalents.</p> <ul> <li>You should avoid 6.xxx if you are not interested in understanding human intelligence from a computational point of view.</li> </ul> <p>Believing that both mind-stretching and near-miss learning are educationally useful, some of the papers I have selected are boring, stupid, or nearly unintelligible. One goal of the subject is to develop the skill of gleaning useful ideas from such papers, but if you have little or no interest in understanding human intelligence, you should not subject yourself to the necessary reading. For more detail on what you will need to read, have a look at the <a href=\"/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-803-the-human-intelligence-enterprise-spring-2006/readings\">readings</a> section.</p> <ul> <li>You should avoid 6.xxx if you already know everything you need to know about communication.</li> </ul> <p>About one-third of the subject is devoted to discussing how to package ideas orally and in writing. You need to be enthusiastic about practicing the skills taught with a positive attitude. For more detail on what will be covered in the communication dimension, have a look at the <a href=\"/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-803-the-human-intelligence-enterprise-spring-2006/assignments\">assignments</a> section.</p> <ul> <li>You should avoid 6.xxx if you are enrolled in another limited-enrollment AI subject or an AI subject whose enrollment should be limited.</li> </ul> <p>Alas, advanced AI subjects are scarce, and fairness dictates that they should be offered as broadly as possible. This fairness goal must be balanced, however, against the need to keep some of them small. If you are just generally interested in AI, you should take one of the graduate lecture-based subjects.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Level</h2> <p>6.803 is the undergraduate version of 6.xxx, and 6.833 is the graduate version. The two differ in that 6.833 may require you to attend some extra classes and will require you to complete a substantial term project. Both meet together ordinarily.</p> <p>The graduate, H-level subject forms a bridge between 6.034 and design/project/thesis work in Artificial Intelligence.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Content</h2> <p>The content of 6.xxx is largely based on papers identified in an informal survey of representative AI leaders, who were asked what has most influenced the way they think about human intelligence. The papers mentioned tend to fall into the following categories, ranked by frequency:</p> <ul> <li>Visionary Thinking by the Giants</li> <li>Computational Models of Perception and Cognition</li> <li>Powerful Computational Ideas</li> <li>Neuroscience and Human Behavior</li> </ul> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Style</h2> <ul> <li>You read parts or all of one or two papers for each class.</li> <li>You discuss the content of those papers in class, occasionally with the authors.</li> </ul> <p>The following mechanisms are used to ensure that you read the papers and absorb the material:</p> <ul> <li>Homework, consisting of either short answers to questions about the papers or the preparation of abstracts, slide shows, and other forms of communication.</li> <li>Verbal questions, often asked of random students during class.</li> </ul> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Limit on Enrollment</h2> <p>Because of the emphasis on reading, discussion, and presentation, enrollment is limited.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Credit and Projects</h2> <p>Doing a substantial project is required for graduate H credit. More details are available in the <a href=\"/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-803-the-human-intelligence-enterprise-spring-2006/projects\">projects</a> section.</p> <h2

All necessary information will be supplied in the lecture notes.</p> <p>The book <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0135258332/ref=nosim/mitopencourse-20\"><em>Essentials of Robust Control</em></a> by Kemin Zhou and John C. Doyle, published by Prentice Hall is a detailed and reasonably modern reference to all or almost all technicalities related to the class material. Anyone who wants to go through the fine details of the famous algorithms for H2 and H-infinity optimization, optimal model order reduction, structured singular values computation etc. will be well advised to buy this book. It may also be a good idea to get hold of a copy of the MATLABÂ® manual for the Mu-Analysis and Synthesis Toolbox: this is a well-written &quot;cookbook&quot; style reference for those primarily interested in applications of H2 and H-Infinity optimization.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Instructor</h2> <p>Prof. Alexandre Megretski</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Homework</h2> <p>Homework assignments are usually posted on the Web on Wednesdays evenings. Homework papers are to be submitted during the next Wednesday. All electronic files used to complete the homework or to visualize the solutions are to be made accessible. The homework will be corrected, graded, and returned as soon as possible. Solutions to the homework will be posted on the Web when the corrected homework is returned.</p> <p>Team work on home assignments is strictly encouraged, as far as generating ideas and arriving at the best possible solution is concerned. However, you have to write your own comments and your own code.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">MATLABÂ®</h2> <p>MATLABÂ®, the &quot;language of technical computing,&quot; will be used extensively. We will need SimulinkÂ® and the Control Systems, LMI Control, and Mu-Analysis and Synthesis Toolboxes. You may wish to consult its online help for general information and for specific commands for simulating and analysing systems.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Examinations</h2> <p>There will be two quizzes, given during lecture hours (dates to be announced soon after beginning of the semester), but no final exam. The quizzes will cover the theory of 6.245 (divided as equally as possible). The questions will be based on the ideas used in the problem set solutions made available at least a week before the test.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Grading</h2> <p>The letter grade will be determined at the end of the semester from a numerical grade N, obtained from the formula</p> <p>N=0.5*H+0.25*Q1+0.25*Q2</p> <p>where H is the average homework grade, and Q1, Q2 are quiz grades (H, Q1, Q2 are numbers between 0 and 100). From the distribution of N for the entire class, boundaries will be chosen to define letter grades. For students near the boundaries, other factors may be taken into account to determine the letter grade, such as effort, classroom activity, etc.</p> <div class=\"help slide-bottom\"> <div class=\"help-message\"> <a class=\"help-engage\" href=\"javascript: trackEvents('Bottom Get Started','bottom get started Click','Help Overlay');\">Need help getting started?</a> <a href=\"javascript:disableHelpPopup(); trackEvents('Bottom Don\\'t Show','bottom don\\'t show Click','Help Overlay');\" class=\"help-dismiss\">Don't show me this again</a> </div> </div> <div class=\"help popup-center\"> <div class=\"help-message\"> <p class=\"help-dismiss\"><a href=\"javascript:disableHelpPopup(); trackEvents('Popup Don\\'t Show','popup don\\'t show Click','Help Overlay');\">Don't show me this again</a></p> <h2>Welcome!</h2> <p>This is one of over 2,200 courses on OCW.

Everything needs feedback. You will never design an electronic or an electromechanical system that does not include a feedback loop, either explicitly or implicitly.</p> <p>Every interface to the real worldâwhether you are building a robot arm, a temperature control system, an audio power amp, or an RF synthesizer (the list goes on and on)âneeds to drive some kind of actuator (a motor, a heater, a power transistor, or an oscillator). To make sure that actuator is doing the right thing, you need to measure the output (its position, its temperature, its voltage, or its frequency) and compare that measurement to what you meant to do. In other words, you need feedback.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Course Content</h2> <p>This course is an introduction to design of feedback systems. Topics covered in the course include properties and advantages of feedback systems, time-domain and frequency-domain performance measures, stability and degree of stability, root locus method, Nyquist criterion, frequency-domain design, compensation techniques, application to a wide variety of physical systems, internal and external compensation of operational amplifiers, modeling and compensation of power converter systems, and phase lock loops.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Laboratory</h2> <p>You will have four short lab projects and a design problem to doâabout one every other weekâranging in subject from operational amplifiers to thermal systems. We hope you find these labs illustrative and informative.</p> <p>We start the term by studying a servomotor mechanism. There are many good reasons for using motors in these four labs (labs 1A, 1B, 1C, and 1D). Most of all, we believe that it is a valuable experience. In your careers as engineers, the systems you design and build will often interface to the real world with motors, actuators, and sensors of all kinds. We believe that these labs are an excellent introduction to this kind of design.</p> <p>In the design problem you will have a choice among several projects.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Prerequisites</h2> <p>The prerequisites for 6.302 are linear systems, circuits, physics, and math. Officially, this requirement is 6.003 or 2.003 or 16.04. Previous laboratory experience with circuits is assumed, such as in 6.002 or 6.071 or 16.04. We also assume that you have not forgotten 8.01 or 8.02, and that you have had some exposure to complex variables (18.04 is helpful, but overkill).</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Course Reference</h2> <p>The reference for this course will be Dr. Kent Lundberg's <em>Notes on Feedback Systems</em>. This text is not available on the MIT OpenCourseWare site.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Other Tips</h2> <ul> <li> We use <a href=\"http://www.mathworks.com/\">MATLABÂ®</a> <a href=\"http://www.mathworks.com/\"></a>and <a href=\"http://www.octave.org/\">Octave</a> for some problem sets that require numerical computations. </li> <li> We recommend <a href=\"http://lwn.net/2000/features/xcircuit/\">xcircuit</a> for drawing schematics. </li> </ul> <div class=\"help slide-bottom\"> <div class=\"help-message\"> <a class=\"help-engage\" href=\"javascript: trackEvents('Bottom Get Started','bottom get started Click','Help Overlay');\">Need help getting started?</a> <a href=\"javascript:disableHelpPopup(); trackEvents('Bottom Don\\'t Show','bottom don\\'t show Click','Help Overlay');\" class=\"help-dismiss\">Don't show me this again</a> </div> </div> <div class=\"help popup-center\"> <div class=\"help-message\"> <p class=\"help-dismiss\"><a href=\"javascript:disableHelpPopup(); trackEvents('Popup Don\\'t Show','popup don\\'t show Click','Help Overlay');\">Don't show me this again</a></p> <h2>Welcome!</h2> <p>This is one of over 2,200 courses on OCW.

Topics covered include: modeling, analysis, and control techniques; design of power circuits including inverters, rectifiers, and DC-DC converters; analysis and design of magnetic components and filters; and characteristics of power semiconductor devices. Numerous application examples will be presented such as motion control systems, power supplies, and radio-frequency power amplifiers. The course is worth 6 engineering design points.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Prerequisite</h2> <p>6.012</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Homework</h2> <p>Problem sets will be issued on a weekly basis, and will be due one week after issue unless otherwise specified. Late problem sets will not be accepted unless previously arranged with the TA. Good problems for 6.334 are very difficult to create, so you will sometimes be assigned a problem used in previous years. <strong>Under no circumstances are you to use 6.334 &quot;bibles&quot; to help you with problem sets</strong>. You may, however, consult with colleagues who are taking 6.334, or who have taken 6.334 in the past. For those of you without access to such colleagues, many graduate students in LEES have taken 6.334 and are willing to help answer questions if you can't arrange to see the TA or Prof. Perreault.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Quizzes</h2> <p>There will be 2 quizzes in 6.334 this term. The tentative dates for these are due two days after Lec #19 and one day after Lec #34. The exams will be closed book and will be given during the evening, starting at 7:30 pm. There is no final exam.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Grading</h2> <p>Grading will be based on three components:</p> <div class=\"maintabletemplate\"> <table class=\"tablewidth50\" summary=\"See table caption for summary.\"> <caption class=\"invisible\">Grading criteria.</caption> <thead align=\"left\"> <tr> <th scope=\"col\">ACTIVITIES</th> <th scope=\"col\">PERCENTAGES</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody align=\"left\"> <tr class=\"row\"> <td>Homework</td> <td>40%</td> </tr> <tr class=\"alt-row\"> <td>Two quizzes (25% each)</td> <td>50%</td> </tr> <tr class=\"row\"> <td>Design project</td> <td>10%</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> </div> <br /> <p>The project will be issued in early April and tentatively due on Lec #37.

OCW does not provide access to this environment.</p> <p>A list of topics covered in the course is available in the <a href=\"#Calendar\">calendar</a>.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Course Meeting Times</h2> <p>Lectures: 2 sessions / week, 1.5 hours / session</p> <p>Recitations: 1 session / week, 1 hour / session </p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Prerequisites</h2> <p>This course presumes a level of solid understanding of LTI systems, discrete-time signals, sampling, Fourier transforms and bilateral z-transforms for both deterministic and stochastic signals. The primary course prerequisite for 6.341 is <a href=\"/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-011-introduction-to-communication-control-and-signal-processing-spring-2004-spring-2005/index.htm\">6.011</a>. If you have not already taken 6.011 and have any doubts as to your understanding of these concepts, we strongly encourage you to take 6.011 before attempting 6.341. 6.341 will assume that you have previously seen and have fluency with the following material in the 6.341 text:</p> <ul> <li>All of Chapters 2 and 3</li> <li>Chapter 4 through Section 4.5</li> <li>Chapter 5 through Section 5.3</li> <li>Appendix A</li> </ul> <p>The first problem set provides a basis for reviewing some of this background. Two days after Lec #4, there will be a diagnostic exam to test your understanding of the background basics. This exam will be designed with the expectation that students who are well prepared in the background will achieve at least an 80% grade. Performance in this exam will not be considered in the final grade but weak performance will be a strong indicator of weakness in your background and potential serious difficulty as we move into more advanced material.</p> <p>It is also important to understand clearly that this is a graduate subject. Consequently, in addition to the formal prerequisites, we assume you have an interest in and commitment to understanding concepts in depth.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Attendance, Lectures and Recitations</h2> <p>Lectures: Tuesday and Thursday, 11:00 am - 12:30 pm<br /> Recitations: Fridays, Section 1 - 11:00 am - 12:00 pm, Section 2 - 3:00 pm - 4:00 pm</p> <p>While attendance at lectures is not formally recorded, it is assumed that you are at all of the lectures. The lecture is scheduled for 11:00-12:30. On occasion, students have tried to simultaneously take a course whose schedule overlaps the 6.341 lecture time, so they do not arrive until 11:30 or have to leave at 12:00. This simply does not work for a variety of reasons, among them the fact that arriving late and leaving early is very disruptive to the rest of the class. <strong>Please avoid arriving late or leaving early</strong>.</p> <p>Attendance at recitations is optional but recommended. You are welcome to choose whichever recitation section best fits your schedule. In these sessions, additional perspectives on the lecture material may be presented, questions and points of confusion will be addressed, and examples and homework problems will be discussed. No new material will be introduced. The first recitation is on Friday, one day after Lec #1. This recitation will focus on the assumed background from 6.011.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Open Hours</h2> <p>The staff is very available during open hours and you are encouraged to come by during the times indicated. While in an emergency the TAs might be willing to meet with you briefly outside of these times, you must remember that they are also taking courses, writing theses, etc.</p> <p>The open hours for Al Oppenheim are unplanned and unstructured discussions of any aspects of the material that those attending would like to discuss. You don't need to come with questions and the larger the group, the more fun and interesting it is likely to be.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Homework</h2> <p>Homework will generally be handed out in lecture on Tuesdays and be due in lecture on Tuesday of the following week (see calendar below for specifics). Some parts of the homework may involve MATLABÂ® exercises. It is assumed that you already have some familiarity with MATLABÂ®.</p> <p>As described in the handout titled &quot;Homework Contract&quot; given in the <a href=\"/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-341-discrete-time-signal-processing-fall-2005/assignments\">assignments</a> section, you are asked to choose between two options, Option 1 in which you do not hand in homework and it is not graded, and Option 2 in which your homework is graded. If you do not explicitly choose Option 2 by signing the Homework Contract, it will be assumed that you have chosen Option 1.</p> <p>There will be approximately 11 problem sets, corresponding to a quasi-weekly schedule. Don't be misled by the relatively few points assigned to homework grades in the final grade calculation. While the grade that you get on your homework is at most a minor component of your final grade, working the problems is a crucial part of the learning process and will invariably have a major impact on your understanding of the material (and, in turn, your exam performance and final grade!).</p> <p>From this perspective, course &quot;bibles&quot; from previous terms are self-defeating and we recommend against using them. However, moderate collaboration in the form of joint problem solving with one or two classmates is permitted and even encouraged provided your write-up is your own. In making up the exams and in assigning final grades, we will assume that you have worked <strong>all</strong> the assigned problems. Typically, one problem on each exam will be strongly based on one of these problems.</p> <p>Some problem sets may contain at least some problems labeled &quot;optional.&quot; You don't turn in solutions to these problems. However, we select these problems with the same care as the assigned problems, and you're likely to find them helpful to do as time permits since they are intended to give you additional practice and insight into the material.</p> <p>Problem sets must be handed in by the end of the class in which they are due, and solutions will be available at the end of the lecture on the same days. Consequently, late problem sets cannot be evaluated. Each problem set that you turn in will be given a score of 0, 1, or 2. A score of 2 is given for a good effort on all or most of the problems (even if not with uniform success); 1 for a reasonable attempt, but with significant gaps; and 0 when there is little evidence of any original thought or effort. For additional feedback on the problems, come to any of the staff's open hours after you've had a chance to look through the solutions we hand out.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Exams</h2> <p>There will be one exam early in the semester, a midterm exam and a final exam during the final exam period. The first exam will be an &quot;answer only&quot; (i.e. no partial credit) exam to test and give you feedback on your background for the remainder of the course. Your grade on this exam will not be counted in the final grade but a grade below 80% will be suggestive of significant weakness in background. The midterm will be more conceptual and comprehensive than the first exam.</p> <p>Both the background quiz and the midterm will be &quot;officially&quot; given from 11:00 am - 12:30 pm to fit within the lecture time. However, the room will be reserved from 11:00 am - 1:00 pm to avoid time pressure at the end of the exam. You may want to allow for the additional half hour in your schedule. The exams will be <strong>closed book</strong>. However, you will be allowed to bring two 8.5 x 11-inch sheets of notes (both sides) to the midterm, and <strong>three</strong> 8.5 x 11-inch sheets of notes (both sides) to the final. No sheets of notes are permitted for the background quiz.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">MATLABÂ®-Based Project and Exercises</h2> <p>One of the best ways of learning much of the material in this course is by exploring many of the concepts with MATLABÂ®. In addition to traditional homework problems, this subject will have a computer laboratory component based on the MATLABÂ® software package provided on Athena. MATLABÂ® is widely used in academic and industrial research laboratories in general, and is well-suited for work in signal processing in particular. Many of you have probably had some experience with MATLABÂ® in undergraduate courses. For those of you who haven't, though, you'll find that among the many attractive features of MATLABÂ® are its ease of use and very short learning curve.</p> <p>There will be two MATLABÂ®-based projects during the term. The details and timetables of the project(s) is given below. Completing the project(s) and associated write-up(s) is a <strong>requirement</strong> of the course and is <strong>not</strong> optional - i.e., to receive a passing grade in the course you must complete the project write-up(s), no matter which homework option you chose.</p> <p>For those of you who might benefit from some initial familiarization with MATLABÂ® tools in anticipation of the project, you will find attempting some of the exercises in the <strong>Computer-Based Exercises</strong> book useful (see the <a href=\"/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-341-discrete-time-signal-processing-fall-2005/readings\">readings</a> section).</p> <p>Some of you may have access to MATLABÂ® running on other machines. Nevertheless, we recommend you do the project directly on Athena. While you are free to explore using the alternate platforms, please keep in mind that the 6.341 staff will only be supporting MATLABÂ® for 6.341 on Athena, and on a number of occasions we will make use of special files and scripts that we've located on Athena specifically for the course. You're welcome to attempt to try to locate and port some of these on your own platform, but please keep in mind that you'll be on your own in such endeavors and we can't guarantee identical results.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Course Grade</h2> <p>The final grade for the course is based on our best assessment of your understanding of the material, as well as your commitment and participation. The exams, problem sets, and projects are combined with the following rough weighting to give a preliminary final grade:</p> <div class=\"maintabletemplate\"> <table class=\"tablewidth50\" summary=\"See table caption for summary.\"> <caption class=\"invisible\">Grading criteria.</caption> <thead align=\"left\"> <tr> <th scope=\"col\">ACTIVITIES</th> <th scope=\"col\">Option 1</th> <th scope=\"col\">Option 2</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody align=\"left\"> <tr class=\"row\"> <td>Midterm</td> <td>35%</td> <td>30%</td> </tr> <tr class=\"alt-row\"> <td>Final Exam</td> <td>45%</td> <td>40%</td> </tr> <tr class=\"row\"> <td>Problem Sets</td> <td>0%</td> <td>15%</td> </tr> <tr class=\"alt-row\"> <td>MATLABÂ® Project(s)</td> <td>20%</td> <td>15%</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> </div> <p>However, this provides only a starting point for assigning the final grade. Other factors such as interaction with the staff, participation in lecture and recitation, etc., can make a significant difference in the final grade. The process of assigning the final grade involves a lot of discussion among the staff and very often a careful review of the final exam to look &quot;behind the numbers&quot; to understand better the kinds of mistakes that were made. We know that the final grade is important to you and we take the process seriously.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\"><a id=\"Calendar\" name=\"alendar\"></a>Calendar</h2> <div class=\"maintabletemplate\"> <table class=\"tablewidth75\" summary=\"See table caption for summary.\"> <caption class=\"invisible\">Course calendar.</caption> <thead align=\"left\"> <tr> <th scope=\"col\">LEC #</th> <th scope=\"col\">TOPICS</th> <th scope=\"col\">KEY DATES</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody align=\"left\"> <tr class=\"row\"> <td>1</td> <td>Course Overview</td> <td>Problem set 1 out</td> </tr> <tr class=\"alt-row\"> <td>2</td> <td>Background Review: Phase, Group Delay, and Generalized Linear Phase</td> <td>Problem set 1 due<br /> <br /> Problem set 2 out</td> </tr> <tr class=\"row\"> <td>3</td> <td>Minimum-phase and All-pass Systems</td> <td></td> </tr> <tr class=\"alt-row\"> <td>4</td> <td>DT Processing of CT Signals and CT Processing of DT Signals: Fractional Delay</td> <td>Problem set 2 due<br /> <br /> Problem set 3 out</td> </tr> <tr class=\"row\"> <td></td> <td>Background Exam</td> <td></td> </tr> <tr class=\"alt-row\"> <td>5</td> <td>Sampling Rate Conversion</td> <td>Problem set 3 due<br /> <br /> Problem set 4 out<br /> <br /> Project 1 out</td> </tr> <tr class=\"row\"> <td>6</td> <td>Quantization and Oversampled Noise Shaping</td> <td></td> </tr> <tr class=\"alt-row\"> <td>7</td> <td>IIR, FIR Filter Structures</td> <td>Problem set 4 due<br /> <br /> Problem set 5 out</td> </tr> <tr class=\"row\"> <td>8</td> <td>Filter Design: IIR Filters</td> <td></td> </tr> <tr class=\"alt-row\"> <td>9</td> <td>Filter Design: FIR Filters</td> <td>Problem set 5 due</td> </tr> <tr class=\"row\"> <td>10</td> <td>Multirate Systems and Polyphase Structures</td> <td>Problem set 6 out</td> </tr> <tr class=\"alt-row\"> <td>11</td> <td>Multirate Systems and Polyphase Structures (cont.)</td> <td></td> </tr> <tr class=\"row\"> <td>12</td> <td>Linear Prediction and All-pole Modeling</td> <td>Problem set 6 due<br /> <br /> Problem set 7 out</td> </tr> <tr class=\"alt-row\"> <td>13</td> <td>The Levinson-Durbin Recursion</td> <td></td> </tr> <tr class=\"row\"> <td>14</td> <td>Guest Lecture: Gene Frantz</td> <td>Problem set 7 due<br /> <br /> Problem set 8 out<br /> <br /> Project 1 due</td> </tr> <tr class=\"alt-row\"> <td>15</td> <td>The Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT)</td> <td></td> </tr> <tr class=\"row\"> <td></td> <td>Midterm Exam</td> <td></td> </tr> <tr class=\"alt-row\"> <td>16</td> <td>Linear Filtering with the DFT</td> <td></td> </tr> <tr class=\"row\"> <td>17</td> <td>Spectral Analysis with the DFT</td> <td>Problem set 8 due<br /> <br /> Problem set 9 out<br /> <br /> Project 2 out</td> </tr> <tr class=\"alt-row\"> <td>18</td> <td>Periodogram</td> <td></td> </tr> <tr class=\"row\"> <td>19</td> <td>FFT Algorithms</td> <td>Problem set 9 due<br /> <br /> Problem set 10 out</td> </tr> <tr class=\"alt-row\"> <td>20</td> <td>The Goertzel Algorithm and the Chirp Transform</td> <td>Problem set 10 due<br /> <br /> Problem set 11 out</td> </tr> <tr class=\"row\"> <td>21</td> <td>Short-time Fourier Analysis</td> <td></td> </tr> <tr class=\"alt-row\"> <td>22</td> <td>Modulated Filter Bank</td> <td>Project 2 due</td> </tr> <tr class=\"row\"> <td>23</td> <td>Caruso's Orchestra</td> <td>Problem set 11 due</td> </tr> <tr class=\"alt-row\"> <td></td> <td>Final Exam</td> <td></td> </tr> </tbody> </table> </div> <div class=\"help slide-bottom\"> <div class=\"help-message\"> <a class=\"help-engage\" href=\"javascript: trackEvents('Bottom Get Started','bottom get started Click','Help Overlay');\">Need help getting started?</a> <a href=\"javascript:disableHelpPopup(); trackEvents('Bottom Don\\'t Show','bottom don\\'t show Click','Help Overlay');\" class=\"help-dismiss\">Don't show me this again</a> </div> </div> <div class=\"help popup-center\"> <div class=\"help-message\"> <p class=\"help-dismiss\"><a href=\"javascript:disableHelpPopup(); trackEvents('Popup Don\\'t Show','popup don\\'t show Click','Help Overlay');\">Don't show me this again</a></p> <h2>Welcome!</h2> <p>This is one of over 2,200 courses on OCW.

A digital communication system is one that transmits a source (voice, video, data, etc.) from one point to another, by first converting it into a stream of bits, and then into symbols that can be transmitted over channels (cable, wireless, storage, etc.). The use of the digital bit-stream as the interface between the source and the channel is universal regardless of what kind of source and channel are involved. Digital communication principle, with &quot;bit&quot; as the most important concept of the information age, and applications in computer science, Internet, wireless, etc, is one of the most successful stories of applying mathematics in engineering designs.</p> <p>The course gives an overview of the designs of digital communication systems. We explain the mathematical foundation of decomposing the systems into separately designed source codes and channel codes. We introduce the principles and some commonly used algorithms in each component, to convert continuous time waveforms into bits, and vice versa. We give a comprehensive introduction to the basics of information theory, a rather thorough treatment of Fourier transforms and the sampling theorem, and an overview of the use of vector spaces in signal processing.</p> <p>The course would be beneficial particularly to students who are interested in doing research in fields related to communications, networks, and signal processing. The general principle and philosophy of the engineering designs discussed in this course are inspiring to all engineering majors. As a Technical Qualifying Exam (TQE) course, we also try to offer some rigorous mathematical training. The materials of this course are the baselines of further studies in <em>6.451 Principles of Digital Communication II</em>, <em>6.452 Principles of Wireless Communication</em>, and <em>6.441 Information Theory</em>.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Prerequisites</h2> <p>The prerequisite for this course is <em>6.011 Introduction to Communication, Control and Signal Processing</em>. Students are expected to have a good undergraduate background in probability and linear systems. Some maturity and patience in looking carefully at fundamental issues is also needed.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Required Text</h2> <p><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0521879078/ref=nosim/mitopencourse-20\"><img alt=\"Buy at Amazon\" border=\"0\" src=\"/images/a_logo_17.gif\" /></a> Gallager, Robert G. <em>Principles of Digital Communication</em>. New York, NY: Cambridge University Press, 2008. ISBN: 9780521879071.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Handouts</h2> <p>Handouts of the lecture slides will be given out at the beginning of lectures.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Problem Sets</h2> <p>There will be 11 weekly problem sets posted online. The final problem set will not be collected. Problem sets will be shorter in weeks involving either quizzes or holidays. You are expected to do all the assigned problems, and we will assume that in making up the quizzes and final. We encourage you to cooperate with each other in doing the problem sets. The problem sets are vehicles for learning, and whatever maximizes learning for you is desirable. This usually includes discussion, teaching of others, and learning from others. You are not competing for grades with your classmates.</p> <p>Problem sets must be handed in by the beginning of the class in which they are due. Graded problem sets will be returned in class. The grades assigned to problem sets will be 0, 1, or 2. Usually only one or two of the problems on a set will be graded, and you are responsible for asking about points of confusion. You are also welcome to flag confusing topics in the problem sets; this will not lower your grade. It will usually be more efficient, however, for you to ask one of us directly about such issues.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Exams</h2> <p>There will be one midterm exam during the semester and a final exam during the finals week. The exams will be closed book, but you may bring three double-sided 8.5&quot; by 11&quot; pages of notes to each of the tests. Most people find that the preparation of such notes helps them much more than the actual use.</p> <p>The midterm is scheduled as shown in the calendar. The final exam is 3 hours long and will be scheduled by the registrar. We will attempt to make the midterm and final exam tests of understanding rather than of speed-writing.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Course Grade</h2> <p>The final grade in the course is based upon our best assessment of your understanding of the material. The final grade is given roughly according to the following rule:</p> <div class=\"maintabletemplate\"><table class=\"tablewidth50\" summary=\"See table caption for summary.\"> <caption class=\"invisible\">Grading criteria.</caption> <thead align=\"left\"> <tr> <th scope=\"col\">ACTIVITIES</th> <th scope=\"col\">PERCENTAGES</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody align=\"left\"> <tr class=\"row\"> <td>Problem sets</td> <td>15%</td> </tr> <tr class=\"alt-row\"> <td>Quizzes</td> <td>35%</td> </tr> <tr class=\"row\"> <td>Final exam</td> <td>50%</td> </tr> </tbody> </table></div> <div class=\"help slide-bottom\"> <div class=\"help-message\"> <a class=\"help-engage\" href=\"javascript: trackEvents('Bottom Get Started','bottom get started Click','Help Overlay');\">Need help getting started?</a> <a href=\"javascript:disableHelpPopup(); trackEvents('Bottom Don\\'t Show','bottom don\\'t show Click','Help Overlay');\" class=\"help-dismiss\">Don't show me this again</a> </div> </div> <div class=\"help popup-center\"> <div class=\"help-message\"> <p class=\"help-dismiss\"><a href=\"javascript:disableHelpPopup(); trackEvents('Popup Don\\'t Show','popup don\\'t show Click','Help Overlay');\">Don't show me this again</a></p> <h2>Welcome!</h2> <p>This is one of over 2,200 courses on OCW.

Our focus is on the design, the analysis, and the fundamental limits of wireless transmission systems, and to develop the foundation for research in this field. To provide the longest term value, our emphasis will be on the basic principles that apply to all such systems, rather than the details of any particular current system or standard. The subject builds naturally on 6.450 (Principles of Digital Communications - I), and complements other follow-on subjects, such as 6.451 (Principles of Digital Communications - II), 6.441 (Transmission of Information), and 6.263 (Data Networks).</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Prerequisites</h2> <p>The prerequisite is 6.450, or permission of the instructors. We rely on 6.450 to build the connection between a real-life communication channel and its digitized models, so that we can focus almost exclusively on the digital designs in the current course. We also require fluency in the main structures and concepts of digital communication systems, as well as the associated probabilistic analysis.</p> <p>We expect students to have some experience in linear algebra and probability. You are recommended to review and evaluate yourself on your fluency using the following textbooks.</p> <p>Bertsekas, Dimitri P., and John N.

Printing out the whole book is however considered a waste of resource and strongly discouraged.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Tentative Topics</h2> <p>We expect to introduce the following topics during the term.</p> <ul> <li>Wireless Channel Models, Noise and Interference</li> <li>Capacity and Outage</li> <li>Diversity and Space-Time Coding</li> <li>Diversity-Multiplexing Tradeoffs</li> <li>Wireless Networks and Resource Management</li> <li>Advanced Topics</li> </ul> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Problem Sets, Project, Quizzes</h2> <p>There will be 3 problem sets, one short project, and two quizzes, scheduled as follows:</p> <div class=\"maintabletemplate\"> <table class=\"tablewidth50\" summary=\"See table caption for summary.\"> <caption class=\"invisible\">Course key dates.</caption> <thead align=\"left\"> <tr> <th scope=\"col\">SES #</th> <th scope=\"col\">KEY DATES</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody align=\"left\"> <tr class=\"row\"> <td>5</td> <td>Problem set 1 out</td> </tr> <tr class=\"alt-row\"> <td>9</td> <td> <p>Problem set 1 due</p> <p>Problem set 2 out</p> </td> </tr> <tr class=\"row\"> <td>13</td> <td>Quiz 1</td> </tr> <tr class=\"alt-row\"> <td>15</td> <td>Problem set 2 due</td> </tr> <tr class=\"row\"> <td>17</td> <td>Problem set 3 out</td> </tr> <tr class=\"alt-row\"> <td>20</td> <td> <p>Problem set 3 due</p> <p>Project out</p> </td> </tr> <tr class=\"row\"> <td>24</td> <td>Project due</td> </tr> <tr class=\"alt-row\"> <td>26</td> <td>Quiz 2</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> </div> <br /> <p>Quiz 1 will be a take-home exam, although we expect students to finish it in around 2 hours. This is part of our effort towards time-pressure-free exams.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Course Grade</h2> <p>The final grade in the course is based upon our best assessment of your understanding of the material during the semester. Roughly, the weights used in grade assignments will be:</p> <div class=\"maintabletemplate\"> <table class=\"tablewidth50\" summary=\"See table caption for summary.\"> <caption class=\"invisible\">Grading criteria.</caption> <thead align=\"left\"> <tr> <th scope=\"col\">ACTIVITIES</th> <th scope=\"col\">PERCENTAGES</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody align=\"left\"> <tr class=\"row\"> <td>Quiz 1</td> <td>35%</td> </tr> <tr class=\"alt-row\"> <td>Quiz 2</td> <td>35%</td> </tr> <tr class=\"row\"> <td>Project</td> <td>20%</td> </tr> <tr class=\"alt-row\"> <td>Homework</td> <td>10%</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> </div> <br /> <p>However, other factors such as interaction with the staff and participation in lecture can make a significant difference in the final grade. In general, the process of assigning a final grade involves a lot of discussion among the staff and a careful review of the quizzes and project. Although the focus of the course is obviously learning, not grades, we know the final grade is important to you, and we want you to know that we take the process seriously.</p> <div class=\"help slide-bottom\"> <div class=\"help-message\"> <a class=\"help-engage\" href=\"javascript: trackEvents('Bottom Get Started','bottom get started Click','Help Overlay');\">Need help getting started?</a> <a href=\"javascript:disableHelpPopup(); trackEvents('Bottom Don\\'t Show','bottom don\\'t show Click','Help Overlay');\" class=\"help-dismiss\">Don't show me this again</a> </div> </div> <div class=\"help popup-center\"> <div class=\"help-message\"> <p class=\"help-dismiss\"><a href=\"javascript:disableHelpPopup(); trackEvents('Popup Don\\'t Show','popup don\\'t show Click','Help Overlay');\">Don't show me this again</a></p> <h2>Welcome!</h2> <p>This is one of over 2,200 courses on OCW.

Its goal is to help the student develop a thorough understanding of the underlying physical principles such that device and system design and performance can be predicted, analyzed, and understood.</p> <p>Most optical systems involve the use of one or more of the following: sources (e.g., lasers and light-emitting diodes), light modulation components (e.g., liquid-crystal light modulators), transmission media (e.g., free space or fibers), photodetectors (e.g., photodiodes, photomultiplier tubes), information storage devices (e.g., optical disk), processing systems (e.g., imaging and spatial filtering systems) and displays (LCOS microdisplays). These are the topics covered by this course.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Textbooks and Reading Materials</h2> <p>Some of the topics that we will cover are still areas of active research and are not yet treated in textbooks. Consequently, a combination of class notes and lecture slides will be provided on each topic. However, several of the basic concepts are covered in the following textbooks: </p><p> </p><p>Goodman, J.

Topics may include: instruction set design; processor micro-architecture and pipelining; cache and virtual memory organizations; protection and sharing; I/O and interrupts; in-order and out-of-order superscalar architectures; VLIW machines; vector supercomputers; multithreaded architectures; symmetric multiprocessors; memory models and synchronization; embedded systems; and parallel computers.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Prerequisite</h2> <p>MIT course 6.004 or equivalent</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Tutorials</h2> <p>A 1.5-hour tutorial session will be held at the end of each week. The main focus of the tutorial session will be to work through the problem set questions and clarify lectures as necessary. Quizzes will also be given in tutorials, so it is important to avoid any recurring conflict with the tutorial time. Additional tutorials may be held in the evenings before quizzes.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Problem Sets</h2> <p>The subject is divided in five modules, each covering a set of related topics. Lectures on each module are followed by a quiz on that module. There is a set of online problems related to each module. The best way to prepare for a quiz is to work on these problems. Although problem solutions do not have to be handed in (and consequently, are not graded), it is essential that students become thoroughly familiar with the material. Many quiz questions will assume knowledge of detailed machine descriptions provided in the problem sets.</p> <p>Students are encouraged to work in groups to discuss the problem sets, then to individually write out complete solutions prior to examining the online solutions. It is our goal to make each problem interesting and illustrative of some aspect of computer design. However, every problem is not equally important to prepare for the quiz; we will indicate which problems are most important for each quiz.</p> <p>Students are encouraged to bring their solutions to the tutorials for discussion, especially if the online solutions are missing or if the student has a different solution then the one posed on the Web site.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Quizzes</h2> <p>In the first lecture, a prerequisite self-evaluation quiz will be handed out. This must be handed back one week later in the lecture. This quiz should be used by you to assess your preparation for the course. You must work individually on this quiz and turn in your own solutions.</p> <p>There will be five one-and-half-hour quizzes, generally scheduled during the tutorial sessions. The quizzes will focus on one section of the course, but can draw upon material from any part of the course to date, including problem sets and assigned readings. All quizzes are closed book.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Grades</h2> <p>Grades will be based on the five quizzes, equally weighted. In addition, each student must turn in the self-evaluation quiz, due in the third lecture.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Collaboration and Academic Honesty Policy</h2> <p>Students must not discuss a quiz's contents with other students who have not yet taken the quiz. If prior to taking it, you are inadvertently exposed to material in a quiz - by whatever means - you must immediately inform the instructor or a TA. You must turn in your own solutions to the self-evaluation quiz. Any violation of this policy will be treated severely.</p> <p>Collaboration amongst students to understand the course material and problem sets is strongly encouraged.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Course Reading Material</h2> <p><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1558605967/ref=nosim/mitopencourse-20\"><img alt=\"Buy at Amazon\" src=\"/images/a_logo_17.gif\" style=\"vertical-align: middle;\" border=\"0\" /></a> Hennessy, J.

We also give the equivalent readings for the 2nd edition of this book to allow you to use a secondhand copy. In previous years, some students found that the lecture notes were sufficient to learn the material and that the textbook was unnecessary, but we nevertheless recommend the book as a good reference guide.</p> <p>To review the basic material, you may also want to refer:</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1558606041/ref=nosim/mitopencourse-20\"><img alt=\"Buy at Amazon\" src=\"/images/a_logo_17.gif\" style=\"vertical-align: middle;\" border=\"0\" /></a> Patterson, D.

Most class meetings will be one half lecture and one half paper discussion. You should read the paper <strong>before</strong> coming to class, and be prepared to discuss it. You can find out what paper to read for each meeting given in the <a href=\"/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-824-distributed-computer-systems-engineering-spring-2006/readings\">readings</a> section.</p> <p>We will post a question about each paper 24 hours before we discuss the paper. Please bring your answer to class on a sheet of paper and hand it in. Your answer need only be long enough to demonstrate that you understand the paper; a paragraph or two will usually be enough. We won't hand back the questions, but we will glance at them to make sure your answer makes sense, and they will count for part of the paper discussion grade.</p> <p>6.824 will have two in-class quizzes.</p> <p>There are programming labs due every week or two for the first half of the term.</p> <p>In the second half of the term you'll undertake a <a href=\"/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-824-distributed-computer-systems-engineering-spring-2006/projects\">project</a> in small teams.

You can hand assignments in late, but the total amount of lateness summed over all the assignments must not exceed 72 hours. If you hand in an assignment late, and your total late time (include the late time for that assignment) exceeds 72 hours, we will give that assignment a grade of D. Note that a D is better than the grade you'd get if you handed in nothing. You can divide up your 72 hours among the assignments however you like; you don't have to ask or tell us. If you want an exception to this rule, please bring us a letter from a dean.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Collaboration Policy</h2> <p>You must write all the code you hand in for the programming assignments, except for code that we give you as part of the assignment. You are not allowed to look at anyone else's solution (and you're not allowed to look at solutions from previous years). You may discuss the assignments with other students, but you may not look at or use each other's code.</p> <p>You may discuss the questions for each discussion paper with other students, but you may not look at other student's answers. You must write your answer yourself.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Useful Books</h2> <p>The following books may help provide background for 6.824 or help with lab programming. None of them are required.

It has been able to withstand rapid growth fairly well and its core protocols have been robust enough to accommodate applications that were unforeseen by the original Internet designers, such as the <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/\">World Wide Web</a>.</p> <p>How does this global network infrastructure work and what are the design principles on which it is based? In what ways are these design principles compromised in practice? How do we make it work better in today's world? How do we ensure that it will work well in the future in the face of rapidly growing scale and heterogeneity? And how should Internet applications be written, so they can obtain the best possible performance both for themselves and for others using the infrastructure? These are some issues that we will grapple with in this course. The course will focus on the design, implementation, analysis, and evaluation of large-scale networked systems.</p> <p><a href=\"/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-829-computer-networks-fall-2002/calendar\">Topics</a> include internetworking philosophies, unicast and multicast routing, congestion control, network quality of service, mobile networking, router architectures, network-aware applications, content dissemination systems, network security, and performance issues. <a href=\"/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-829-computer-networks-fall-2002/readings\">Material</a> for the course will be drawn from research papers, industry white papers, and <a href=\"http://www.ietf.org/rfc.html\">Internet RFCs</a>.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Prerequisites</h2> Undergraduate systems or networks course covering basic networking concepts (e.g., 6.033 or equivalent). Consent of instructor if you are an undergraduate. <p>If your networking background is rusty, you should page material in from one of these excellent books. In particular, I highly recommend the book by Peterson and Davie or the book by Kurose and Ross.</p> <p>Knowledge of elementary probability (e.g., 6.041, 6.042, or equivalent) and some applied statistics will be helpful.</p> <p>Enrollment may be limited.</p> <p>If you feel you know enough about networking, an alternative subject to 6.829 is 6.824. 6.824 is a graduate equivalent of 6.829, but focuses on the engineering of computer systems. If you are a graduate (esp. PhD) student in systems or networking, we recommend that you take both classes during your graduate career at MIT. You must not take them both in the same term, though, since both have heavy-duty projects.</p> <p>If you're an undergraduate and want practical experience with computer systems, consider 6.097, where you'll learn how to build a stripped-down functioning kernel from scratch.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Course Structure</h2> Lectures will discuss assigned readings from the literature. 6.829 will emphasize the practical aspects of computer networks and the Internet, and will be centered around discussions and arguments! Class participation is therefore very important and will count towards your grade. <h2 class=\"subhead\">Grading</h2> <p>The largest contributor to the final grade is a significant course project with a research emphasis. At the end of the term, students will submit a conference-style paper describing the project and its key contributions/findings, and make a 20-minute presentation of their work at the end of the term. This will constitute 40% of your grade. Start early! </p> <p>In addition, there will be a few problem sets assigned during the term. We expect to use the VINT network simulator, ns-2 for some of the problem set questions. In many cases, we expect ns-2 to be useful for your project too. We strongly encourage you to get familiar with ns-2 as soon as you can, by installing it on your machine and playing with it. While not comprehensive, the available documentation is quite good and adequate to start using it. Problem sets will constitute 25% of your grade.</p> <p>We will have two in-class quizzes. These count for 30% of your final grade.</p> <p>Finally, class participation and performance in surprise quizzes (we reserve the right to hand out a few of these during the term) counts for 5% of your grade.</p> <p>In summary:</p> <p>40% - Course project (paper + presentation)<br /> 25% - Problem sets<br /> 30% - Two quizzes<br /> 5% - Class participation, enthusiasm and energy-level!</p> <p>Remember, this is a graduate class and grades should not be your primary or only motivator! What matters is how much you learn about research in networking and how much it excites you. We hope that this class and the project you work on meet that goal.</p> <div class=\"help slide-bottom\"> <div class=\"help-message\"> <a class=\"help-engage\" href=\"javascript: trackEvents('Bottom Get Started','bottom get started Click','Help Overlay');\">Need help getting started?</a> <a href=\"javascript:disableHelpPopup(); trackEvents('Bottom Don\\'t Show','bottom don\\'t show Click','Help Overlay');\" class=\"help-dismiss\">Don't show me this again</a> </div> </div> <div class=\"help popup-center\"> <div class=\"help-message\"> <p class=\"help-dismiss\"><a href=\"javascript:disableHelpPopup(); trackEvents('Popup Don\\'t Show','popup don\\'t show Click','Help Overlay');\">Don't show me this again</a></p> <h2>Welcome!</h2> <p>This is one of over 2,200 courses on OCW.

Humans and animals move much more aggressively by routinely executing motions which involve a loss of instantaneous control authority. Controlling nonlinear systems without complete control authority requires methods that can reason about and exploit the natural dynamics of our machines.</p> <p>This course discusses nonlinear dynamics and control of underactuated mechanical systems, with an emphasis on machine learning methods. Topics include nonlinear dynamics of passive robots (walkers, swimmers, flyers), motion planning, partial feedback linearization, energy-shaping control, analytical optimal control, reinforcement learning/approximate optimal control, and the influence of mechanical design on control. Discussions include examples from biology and applications to legged locomotion, compliant manipulation, underwater robots, and flying machines.</p> <p>For course 6, area II students, this course will fulfill the Technical Qualifying Exam (TQE) requirement for artificial intelligence.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Prerequisites</h2> <p>Students actively engaged in robotics or related research should have all of the necessary prerequisites. Relevant course include introductory classes in robotics (<em>6.141J/16.405J Robotics: Science and Systems I, 2.12 Introduction to Robotics</em>, and <em>2.165 Robotics</em> or equivalent), control (<em>6.302 Feedback Systems</em>), and machine learning (<em>6.867 Machine Learning</em>). Some familiarity with MATLABÂ® is recommended. Students from all departments are welcome.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Textbooks</h2> <p>There are no required textbooks for this course. Readings will come from the course notes &quot;Underactuated Robotics: Learning, Planning, and Control for Efficient and Agile Machines.&quot; A list of relevant textbooks is given in the <a href=\"/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-832-underactuated-robotics-spring-2009/readings\">Readings</a> section.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Course Goals</h2> <p>The goal of this course is to develop the tools necessary to design robots that are more dynamic and more agile than the current state-of-the-art. The course is organized into three main parts: nonlinear dynamics, motion planning and control (classical and modern), and machine learning control.</p> <p>The target audience includes both computer science and mechanical/aeronautics students pursuing research in robotics. Although I assume familiarity with basic robot kinematics and dynamics and comfort with linear algebra, ordinary differential equations, and MATLABÂ®, the course notes will provide most of the material and references required for the course.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Grading</h2> <p>Late problem sets will be penalized 10% per day.

Permission to work individually may be granted, but only in special circumstances. A team can collaborate extensively to ensure a timely project completion.</p> <p>The following excerpts from &quot;The Mayfield Handbook of Technical and Scientific Writing&quot; describe the guidelines for appropriate academic conduct:</p> <blockquote> <h3 class=\"subsubhead\">Legal and Ethical Issues</h3> <p>Research in science and engineering, as in most professions, sometimes poses unexpected legal and ethical problems. These problems will often become apparent at the writing stage of a project. When written claims are made, the concreteness and technical quality of many statements can mask limitations and inconsistencies, thus posing potential legal and ethical problems. Here are some things to keep in mind:</p> <ul> <li>The expert uses his or her specialized knowledge to solve a problem. Hence, the expert assumes an authority and uses a language that the lay person is usually not able to judge. Some sources of liability include a failure to point out alternatives, failure to note negative secondary effects, failure to give the whole picture, failure to acknowledge gaps in logic, and failure to cite or credit sources.</li> <li>Be aware of potential sources of plagiarism. Be sure you understand what plagiarism is. It is the copying, whether deliberate or unintentional, of ideas or portions of text without citing the sources for credit. It is also the use of other people's ideas without attributing them to the proper source. Although plagiarism is often unintentional, it still demonstrates incompetence. If you fail to record your sources and then later forget that you used a source, you are still liable and open to the charge of theft of intellectual property</li> </ul> <h3 class=\"subsubhead\">Citing Sources and Listing References</h3> <p>Whenever you include another person's information or wording in a document, you must acknowledge the source and include a citation that will tell the reader where you obtained it. If you do not do so, you deprive your reader of the ability to locate information that he or she might want to explore further. In addition, you may be committing intellectual theft, plagiarism.</p> <p>Mechanisms that allow a reader to verify the information presented in a document are essential parts of most types of technical and scientific writing. Procedures sections of technical and laboratory reports, for example, provide the reader with information sufficient to replicate both the method and the data described in the document.</p> <p>There are two basic and universal rules regarding the use of information in professional and, especially, academic writing:</p> <ul> <li>If you use the language of your source, you must quote it exactly, enclose it in quotation marks, and cite the source.</li> <li>If you use ideas or information that are not common knowledge, you must cite the source.</li> </ul> </blockquote> <div class=\"help slide-bottom\"> <div class=\"help-message\"> <a class=\"help-engage\" href=\"javascript: trackEvents('Bottom Get Started','bottom get started Click','Help Overlay');\">Need help getting started?</a> <a href=\"javascript:disableHelpPopup(); trackEvents('Bottom Don\\'t Show','bottom don\\'t show Click','Help Overlay');\" class=\"help-dismiss\">Don't show me this again</a> </div> </div> <div class=\"help popup-center\"> <div class=\"help-message\"> <p class=\"help-dismiss\"><a href=\"javascript:disableHelpPopup(); trackEvents('Popup Don\\'t Show','popup don\\'t show Click','Help Overlay');\">Don't show me this again</a></p> <h2>Welcome!</h2> <p>This is one of over 2,200 courses on OCW.

The course will give the student the basic ideas and intuition behind modern machine learning methods as well as a bit more formal understanding of how, why, and when they work. The underlying theme in the course is statistical inference as it provides the foundation for most of the methods covered.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Problem Sets</h2> <p>There will be a total of 5 problem sets, due roughly every two weeks. The content of the problem sets will vary from theoretical questions to more applied problems. You are encouraged to collaborate with other students while solving the problems but you will have to turn in your own solutions. Copying will not be tolerated. If you collaborate, you must indicate all of your collaborators.</p> <p>Each problem set will be graded by a group of students with the guidance of your TAs. Each problem set will be graded in a single grading session, usually on the first Monday after it is due, starting at 5pm. Every student is required to participate in one grading session. You should sign up for grading by contacting a TA, by email or in person; doing it early increases the chances of getting the preferred grading schedule. Students who do not register for grading by the third week of the course, will be assigned to a problem set by us.</p> <p>If you drop the class after signing up for a grading session, please be sure to let us know so we can keep track of students available for grading. If you add the class during the term, please remember to sign up for grading.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Exams</h2> <p>There will be two in-class exams, a midterm midway through the term and a final the last day of class.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Project</h2> <p>You are required to complete a class project. The choice of the topic is up to you so long as it clearly pertains to the course material. To ensure that you are on the right track, you will have to submit a one paragraph description of your project a month before the project is due. Similarly to problem sets, you are encouraged to collaborate on the project. We expect a four page write-up about the project, which should clearly and succinctly describe the project goal, methods, and your results. Each group should submit only one copy of the write-up and include all the names of the group members (a two person group will have 6 pages, a three person group will have 8 pages, and so on). The projects will be graded on the basis of your understanding of the overall course material (not based on, e.g., how brilliantly your method works). The scope of the project is about 1-2 problem sets.</p> <p>The projects are due in Lec #23. Electronic submission is required but we can accept only postscript or pdf documents. The short proposal should be turned in on or before Lec #12.</p> <p>The projects can be literature reviews, theoretical derivations or analyses, applications of machine learning methods to problems you are interested in, or something else (to be discussed with course staff).</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Grading</h2> <p>Your overall grade will be determined roughly as follows:</p> <div class=\"maintabletemplate\"> <table class=\"tablewidth50\" summary=\"See table caption for summary.\"> <caption class=\"invisible\">Grading criteria.</caption> <thead align=\"left\"> <tr> <th scope=\"col\">ACTIVITIES</th> <th scope=\"col\">PERCENTAGES</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody align=\"left\"> <tr class=\"row\"> <td>Midterm</td> <td>15%</td> </tr> <tr class=\"alt-row\"> <td>Problem sets</td> <td>30%</td> </tr> <tr class=\"row\"> <td>Final</td> <td>25%</td> </tr> <tr class=\"alt-row\"> <td>Project</td> <td>30%</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> </div> <br /> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Text</h2> <p>There are a number of useful texts for this course but each covers only some part of the class material.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0198538642/ref=nosim/mitopencourse-20\"><img alt=\"Buy at Amazon\" src=\"/images/a_logo_17.gif\" align=\"absMiddle\" border=\"0\" /></a> Bishop, Christopher. <em>Neural Networks for Pattern Recognition</em>.

Exploratory behaviorâmeans for decoupling goals from strategy. Escape from the constraints of expression-based language. Working with partially-specified entities. Managing multiple view points.</p> <p>Strategies include language layering, generate-test separation, and propagation. Techniques to be discussed are generic operations, combinators, backtracking, dependencies, and incremental refinement.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Readings</h2> <p>The readings for this subject will be taken from a variety of sources. There will be assigned readings with each problem set. All of the books we need will be on reserve in the library. You will need SICP (Abelson, Sussman, and Sussman; <em>Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs</em>). Material from that book will be referred to quite often. This book is available online, but dead trees are often easier to work with.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0262011530/ref=nosim/mitopencourse-20\"><img border=\"0\" align=\"absMiddle\" src=\"/images/a_logo_17.gif\" alt=\"Buy at Amazon\" /></a> Abelson, Harold, Gerald Jay Sussman, and Julie Sussman. <a href=\"http://mitpress.mit.edu/books/structure-and-interpretation-computer-programs\"><em>Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs</em></a>. 2nd ed.

The default arrangement is that the assignment is due on Wednesday the next week. Most of the assignments will require the use of a computer running <a href=\"http://www.gnu.org/software/mit-scheme/\">MIT/GNU Scheme</a>, which runs on most systems, including GNU/Linux, Windows, and Mac OS. This is <em>free software</em>. We will provide any other software needed.</p> <p>See <a href=\"http://www.fsf.org/licensing/essays/free-sw.html\">this link</a> to find out what is meant by &quot;free software&quot;.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Projects</h2> <p>Just before spring break you will propose an extended project, which will be due by the end of the term. In this project you will design and build a significant piece of symbolic-manipulation software. If you don't come up with a great idea yourself, we have some ideas that you might pursue. You will be expected to write elegant code that can be easily read and understood by us. You must supply a clear English explanation of how your software works, and a set of test cases illustrating and testing its operation. You will present a brief summary and demo in class near the end of the term.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Grades</h2> <p>The grades for this subject will be determined by a combination of classroom participation, homework, and project work. There are no examinations in this subject. <em>We expect you to be at every class and to work every problem set.</em></p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Collaborative Work</h2> <p>Many people learn more effectively when they study in small groups and cooperate in various other ways on homework. We are very much in favor of this kind of cooperation <em>so long as all participants actively involve themselves in all aspects of the work</em>. When you hand in a paper with your name on it we assume that you are certifying it as your work and that you were involved in all aspects of it. Even if you work with others you should do the write up separately, and you should indicate the names of any collaborators for each part of the assignment. However, we encourage you to make the final project a team effort with a joint presentation and write up, so please try to find collaborators early in the term for this work.</p> <div class=\"help slide-bottom\"> <div class=\"help-message\"> <a class=\"help-engage\" href=\"javascript: trackEvents('Bottom Get Started','bottom get started Click','Help Overlay');\">Need help getting started?</a> <a href=\"javascript:disableHelpPopup(); trackEvents('Bottom Don\\'t Show','bottom don\\'t show Click','Help Overlay');\" class=\"help-dismiss\">Don't show me this again</a> </div> </div> <div class=\"help popup-center\"> <div class=\"help-message\"> <p class=\"help-dismiss\"><a href=\"javascript:disableHelpPopup(); trackEvents('Popup Don\\'t Show','popup don\\'t show Click','Help Overlay');\">Don't show me this again</a></p> <h2>Welcome!</h2> <p>This is one of over 2,200 courses on OCW.

Additional materials, updated as needed by Professor de Neufville, can be found there.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Important Notes</h2> <ul> <li>This course emphasizes the development of &quot;application portfolios&quot;. These assignments show how the course material applies to each student's own professional interests (see the <a href=\"/courses/engineering-systems-division/esd-71-engineering-systems-analysis-for-design-fall-2008/assignments\">assignments</a> section). Students have routinely incorporated these applications in their research, thesis, and professional presentations.</li> <li>The subject assumes that participants are competent in the material covered by ESD.70J, the 3-unit micro-subject that covers Excel spreadsheet analyses. Go to that site for a self-assessment of whether you need to audit that subject (experience indicates you probably do).</li> </ul> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Organization of Subject</h2> <p>This subject focuses on the flexible design of engineering systems. It recognizes that the future is necessarily uncertain, and that we need to deliver good value for the range of possible scenarios. Flexible designs enable system operators to adapt their project to future circumstances, to avoid downside risks and to take advantage of upside opportunities.</p> <p>Many researchers and practitioners believe that flexible design will revolutionize the way we develop and manage complex projects. Indeed, case studies indicate that the approach can improve expected performance by around 25 percent. These are significant opportunities.</p> <p>The course shows how design flexibility can substantially increase the expected value of a system. It presents an integrated approach that</p> <ul> <li>properly deals with evaluation over time in risky situations, and</li> <li>pinpoints the value of specific design elements.</li> </ul> <p>The course consists of 3 major blocks.</p> <h3 class=\"subsubhead\">Basics: Recognition of Uncertainty, Valuation Fundamentals, and Timing Issues</h3> <p>This introductory block establishes three fundamental issues and provides the economic motivation for flexibility in design:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Recognition of Uncertainty</strong> is the crucial starting point. The understanding that the future is uncertain and that we must design our systems to operate in many possible scenarios provides the motivation for making our systems adaptable, for building flexibility into them.</li> <li><strong>Valuation Fundamentals</strong> covers the main analytic and conceptual issues associated with the valuation long-term projects. Here, the primary concern is with the relative value of the projects over time.</li> <li><strong>Timing Issues</strong> discusses the design issues â principally economies of scale and learning curves â that affect the tradeoff between building larger projects initially versus developing systems incrementally over time.</li> </ul> <h3 class=\"subsubhead\">Uncertainty Modeling and Flexibility Valuation Methods</h3> <p>This is the core analytic section of the course. It presents Decision Analysis and Lattice Analysis as the two means to assess the value of flexibility in design. Both provide ways to think through the many ways in which scenarios will occur over time, and correspondingly how system developers can react effectively to these alternate futures. Decision Analysis makes is possible to look at more complex futures, while Lattice Analysis is computationally much more efficient. Analysts need to understand the relative merits of each approach and which to use when, either singly or in combination.</p> <p>This section builds upon the Monte Carlo simulation methods presented in the Excel mini-course (ESD.70J) given at the start of the semester.</p> <h3 class=\"subsubhead\">Flexibility Identification Methods &quot;in&quot; Systems</h3> <p>This section explores the question of how designers can identify the parts of the system that should be flexible. The issue is that any significant system could be flexible in many, many different ways and it is important to identify which elements might most effectively contribute to increasing the expected value of the overall system. This is a primary area of current research, and the course will showcase current and recent doctoral research and other projects at the forefront of the field.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Prerequisites</h2> <p>This subject builds upon a basic knowledge of calculus and probability.</p> <p>Students should be proficient in the use of spreadsheet programs at the level covered by ESD.70J, the 3-unit intensive short course designed to bring them up to speed in Excel. In general, everyone will benefit from participating in this offering.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Course Materials</h2> <p>The primary text for the class consists of draft chapters from the new text being written for the MIT Press. Prof. de Neufville will distribute these electronically throughout the semester.</p> <p>This material is supplemented by chapters from:</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0070163723/ref=nosim/mitopencourse-20\"><img align=\"absMiddle\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Buy at Amazon\" src=\"/images/a_logo_17.gif\" /></a> de Neufville, Richard. <em>Applied Systems Analysis</em>. New York, NY: McGraw-Hill, 1990. ISBN: 9780070163720.</p> <p>Extensive references and papers are available from the <a href=\"http://ardent.mit.edu/real_options/ROcse_MIT_latest/index.html\">course Web site</a>.</p> <p>All students will be expected to have an up-to-date full version of Excel. They may also want to try the following optional add-ins:</p> <p><strong>TreeAge Pro</strong> can be downloaded for a 21-day trial from: <a href=\"http://treeage-pro.software.informer.com/6.0/\">TreeAge Pro Trial Version Download</a>, and student licenses can be obtained from: <a href=\"https://www.treeage.com/shop/\">The TreeAge Software Store</a>.</p> <p><strong>Crystal Ball</strong> information is available here: <a href=\"http://www.oracle.com/industries/education/oracle-crystal-ball-classroom-edition.html\">Oracle Crystal Ball Classroom Edition</a>.</p> <p>Participants can view and download PDF copies of the PowerPoint slides on the course Web site. As the instructors routinely improve their presentations as the class proceeds, the Web versions of the slides change from time to time. Students may wish to verify that they have the latest version before downloading the slides for reference in class.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Recitations</h2> <p>There will be regular weekly problem-solving sessions. Prof. de Neufville will schedule these in consultation with the class during the opening session.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Assignments</h2> <p>The graded assignments for the class mainly involve the &quot;application portfolio&quot;. This is a collection of applications, on topics individually selected by each student, using the methods presented in class on an issue. This has two phases:</p> <ul> <li>Individual assignments throughout the semester.</li> <li>A final portfolio that builds upon the individual assignments and the feedback during the semester. It will present an integrated whole so that each student will each have a completed case study demonstrating how they can use design flexibility to increase the expected value of their systems.</li> </ul> <p>Ungraded problems drawn from the <em>Applied Systems Analysis</em> text are distributed throughout the semester. Students are advised to complete them as a way of insuring that they know how to complete the applications â and pass the tests! Solutions to these problems will be posted so that students can grade themselves and get immediate feedback.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Grading</h2> <p>Grades depend principally on the application portfolio and tests, but include an allowance for class participation. The approximate weights are:</p> <div class=\"maintabletemplate\"><table class=\"tablewidth50\" summary=\"See table caption for summary.\"> <caption class=\"invisible\">Grading criteria.</caption> <thead align=\"left\"> <tr> <th scope=\"col\">ACTIVITIES</th> <th scope=\"col\">PERCENTAGES</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody align=\"left\"> <tr class=\"row\"> <td>Individual and final application portfolio</td> <td>40%</td> </tr> <tr class=\"alt-row\"> <td>Class participation and graded assignments</td> <td>15%</td> </tr> <tr class=\"row\"> <td>Mid-semester quiz</td> <td>20%</td> </tr> <tr class=\"alt-row\"> <td>Final examination</td> <td>25%</td> </tr> </tbody> </table></div> <p> </p> <p>Students should complete assignments on time. The teaching assistant will mark down unexcused late assignments.</p> <p>The instructors will modulate the final grade in appreciation of the participant's progress throughout the semester. Those who finish strongly and demonstrate that they have, at the end, mastered the material will receive more credit for the final grades.</p> <p>Previous quizzes and exams are posted in the &quot;Exercises&quot; section of the Web page. They indicate the kind of questions likely to appear on future exams. However, their content may not match the current syllabus, which is evolving along with research advances.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Academic Honesty</h2> <p>To avoid confusion that might result from different expectations in other contexts or establishments, please note the standards that apply in this subject:</p> <ul> <li>Assignments turned in for grading must be done individually. The instructors understand that students will discuss the course and often learn best collectively. However, students should prepare their reports for each assignment individually, in their own format and words.</li> <li>Demonstrated evidence of copying (exactly the same presentation, same wording of sentences, etc.) will result in zeros for each paper with this evidence.</li> <li>Anyone found cheating in an examination (copying from another student or using unauthorized materials, etc.) will receive a zero for the event.</li> <li>Material copied from other sources (articles, reports, Web pages, etc) must be properly cited. Evidence that material has been taken from elsewhere without citation will be treated as plagiarism.</li> <li>Prof. de Neufville will place a note in the student record of each person associated with plagiarism or cheating. MIT views these infractions seriously and routinely expels students who seriously violate our academic standards.</li> </ul> <p>Any questions about this policy should be addressed to the instructors.</p> <div class=\"help slide-bottom\"> <div class=\"help-message\"> <a class=\"help-engage\" href=\"javascript: trackEvents('Bottom Get Started','bottom get started Click','Help Overlay');\">Need help getting started?</a> <a href=\"javascript:disableHelpPopup(); trackEvents('Bottom Don\\'t Show','bottom don\\'t show Click','Help Overlay');\" class=\"help-dismiss\">Don't show me this again</a> </div> </div> <div class=\"help popup-center\"> <div class=\"help-message\"> <p class=\"help-dismiss\"><a href=\"javascript:disableHelpPopup(); trackEvents('Popup Don\\'t Show','popup don\\'t show Click','Help Overlay');\">Don't show me this again</a></p> <h2>Welcome!</h2> <p>This is one of over 2,200 courses on OCW.

Basic principles of organization and function of the nervous system will be discussed and frequent reference will be made to pathophysiology of neurological and psychiatric disorders. By this approach we hope to provide physician/scientists and Ph.D. candidates with a dynamic picture of the rapidly evolving field of neuroscience and the experimental process from which the picture is derived. We hope that all students will emerge with a greater awareness both of the applications of their work in alleviating disease, and of the ways that disease can provide insight into basic scientific questions.</p> <p>The course will span modern neuroscience from molecular neurobiology to perception and cognition, including the following major topics: anatomy and development of the brain; cell biology of neurons and glia; ion channels and electrical signaling; synaptic transmission, integration, and chemical systems of the brain; sensory systems, from transduction to perception; motor systems; and higher brain function (memory, language, affective disorders).</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Readings</h2> <p>Readings are from primary research literature as well as the course text:</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0838577016/ref=nosim/mitopencourse-20\"><img alt=\"Buy at Amazon\" src=\"/images/a_logo_17.gif\" align=\"absMiddle\" border=\"0\" /></a> Kandel, Eric R., James H.

These topics are not traditionally taught in tandem, though a structure course and thermodynamics course are usually part of the first core courses taken in a Materials Science and Engineering curriculum. The motivation for bringing these subjects together in 3.012 is to aid in teaching you the conceptual ties between these subjects. Bonding dictates structure, and structure in turn provides constraints on the thermodynamic properties of materials. These topics are intimately related and a full understanding of materials' synthesis, fabrication, and processing relies on bringing out these interconnections. In addition, it is enlightening to learn about the same materials from different viewpoints, to better appreciate the diverse perspectives we take when looking at materials science: What is the crystal structure of diamond? How does it affect its thermodynamics properties? How is it related to the nature of the bonding between carbon atoms? One then begins to see how these fundamental properties of materials are connected.</p> <p>Many fascinating materials phenomena will become clear in the course of the class - Why are some materials easily polarized in one direction and not in another? Why are the heat capacities of very different crystals nearly equal at high temperatures? How do electrons &quot;tunnel&quot; through high barriers, and how can we exploit this to image atoms and molecules in real time? What prevents certain processes from occurring, while others proceed spontaneously? In addition, structure, bonding, and thermodynamic behavior underlie nearly every application of materials to a greater or lesser extent, and these topics play significant roles in the properties of materials that you will learn about in the coming 3 years.</p> <h3 class=\"subsubhead\">Explanation of Course Units</h3> <p>The units reported in the course catalog: (5) (0) (10) appear confusing, given the course schedule (6 hours lecture per week, 2 hours recitation per week) - recall the units system is (hours lecture/recitation) (hours lab) (hours outside class). This is due to the integration of 3.012 with the laboratory course 3.014 - which runs 4 weeks of the term, and takes over the lecture time for 3.012 during lab weeks. Thus the course catalog units reflect an 'average' value measured over the entire term. In practice, you will have 2 hours lecture Monday Wednesday Friday, along with 2 recitations of 1 hour each on Tuesday and Thursday - <strong>during</strong> '3.012' weeks. During '3.014' lab weeks, 3.012 <strong>will not be in session</strong>. The schedule of the lecture/lab sessions is shown in the <a href=\"/courses/materials-science-and-engineering/3-012-fundamentals-of-materials-science-fall-2005/calendar\">calendar</a> section.</p> <h3 class=\"subsubhead\">Prerequisites or Corequisites</h3> <p>One of the following: <a href=\"/courses/mathematics/18-03sc-differential-equations-fall-2011\">18.03</a>, <a href=\"/courses/mathematics/18-034-honors-differential-equations-spring-2004/index.htm\">18.034</a>, <a href=\"/courses/materials-science-and-engineering/3-016-mathematics-for-materials-scientists-and-engineers-fall-2005/index.htm\">3.016</a></p> <h3 class=\"subsubhead\">Textbooks</h3> <p>Two textbooks are required for this class.</p> <ul> <li><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/080533842X/ref=nosim/mitopencourse-20\"><img border=\"0\" align=\"absMiddle\" alt=\"Buy at Amazon\" src=\"/images/a_logo_17.gif\" /></a> Engel, T., and P.

Were you diligent in doing the problem sets? The purpose of giving you these score assignments is to give you some indication of how you are doing as the term progresses.</p> <p>3. Problem Sets:</p> <p>Each problem set will contain 2-3 problems from structure/bonding and 2-3 problems from thermodynamics that will be graded. Problem sets can be turned in at recitation/lecture on the due date, or you may leave them in the drop box outside Prof. Irvine's office no later than 5 pm on the due date.</p> <p><strong>Important: Problem Set Turn-in Policy</strong> - The problems sets are a critical part of learning the material in this course. Generally, the problem set solutions will be provided immediately after the turn-in deadline. Late problem sets will not be accepted (they will be scored as zero points).</p> <p>4. Exams:</p> <p>Each exam will contain approximately half thermodynamics problems, and half structure/bonding questions.

The laboratory subject combines experiments illustrating the principles of quantum mechanics, thermodynamics and structure with intensive oral and written technical communication practice. Labs run during 4 intensive week-long periods interspersed through the semester; each week emphasizes three topical themes related to 3.012. During weeks in which 3.014 is in session, 3.012 does not meet.</p> <p>The class of typically 50 students is divided into six lab groups. During each lab week, six separate 4-hour experiments run simultaneously, grouped into three topical themes. Each lab group conducts 1 of the 2 experiments grouped under each theme (Î±, Î², Î³). Hence, each lab group will perform 3 experiments per lab week, totaling to 12 experimental sessions of 4-hours each over the course of the semester.</p> <p>Each lab experiment is designed to give students first-hand experience with the concepts developed in the lecture subject 3.012. In addition, students gain familiarity with common tools for materials characterization, including differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), x-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning probe microscopy (AFM/STM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), UV/Vis, Raman and FTIR spectroscopy, x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), vibrating sample magnetometry (VSM) and dynamic light scattering (DLS).</p> <p>Students complete mandatory laboratory and radiation safety training prior to their first lab session. To prepare for specific labs, students are provided with background notes tailored to the experiment to be conducted. The notes provide only background information, but do not generally detail the specific experiments to be conducted, or the procedures involved. Students are responsible for recording procedure, data, data analysis in their laboratory notebooks, and build their formal laboratory reports based on these recordings.</p> <p>In 3.014, each student completes only half of the 24 total experiments conducted each semester. Connections between different experiments under the same topical theme (Î±, Î², or Î³) are made during two 1-hour recitation sections that run on alternate days from the lab. In these mandatory, highly interactive sessions, students report their past-day's findings at the black board in an impromptu fashion and respond to questions from instructors and peers.</p> <p>The graded communications portion of the subject includes:</p> <ol> <li>Student lab notebooks</li> <li>Mandatory interactive recitations</li> <li>One poster or oral presentation</li> <li>One journal article</li> <li>One technical report</li> <li>One memorandum, written in a 3 hour final exam session with only the student's lab notebook to serve as a reference</li> </ol> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Safety</h2> <p>All students must pass the on-line safety training offered by MIT's Environmental Health and Safety (EHS) Office prior to working in the lab in 3.014. Students will need to complete on-line training courses for General Chemical Hygiene and Managing Hazardous Waste. Students should complete their on-line training before the first lab session.</p> <p>As a supplement to the EHS on-line training, students are required to attend the EHS classroom training for individuals working with potentially hazardous chemicals in the lab and radiation.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Lab Notebooks</h2> <p>Each student will be required to maintain a <strong>bound</strong> laboratory notebook into which original entries are to be made <strong>in ink</strong>. <strong>Original</strong> notes on procedures, experimental observations, data, data analysis, etc. should be made in it. This information will serve as the principal source for constructing the laboratory reports, so it's important to keep careful records of the work. Notebooks will be collected for grading periodically during the term. Guidelines for keeping a lab notebook will be handed out prior to the first lab date.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Lab Reports</h2> <p>3.014 fulfills the institute communication requirement (CI-M) through a combination of written and oral reporting on experiments performed in the class. Students will report on one of the three experiments performed during each of the lab weeks, designated by the instructors. Reports will be due the week following each lab. In addition, a memo based on Lab week 4 will be written during the 3-hour final exam period.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Grading</h2> <p>In 3.014, student's final grade will be determined from the grades received for their participation in labs and recitations, laboratory notebook, 2 written reports, poster, and final exam with the percentage breakdown as given below.</p> <div class=\"maintabletemplate\"> <table class=\"tablewidth50\" summary=\"See table caption for summary.\"> <caption class=\"invisible\">Grading criteria.</caption> <thead align=\"left\"> <tr> <th scope=\"col\">ACTIVITIES</th> <th scope=\"col\">PERCENTAGES</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody align=\"left\"> <tr class=\"row\"> <td>Class Participation</td> <td>15%</td> </tr> <tr class=\"alt-row\"> <td>Laboratory Notebook</td> <td>10%</td> </tr> <tr class=\"row\"> <td>Poster</td> <td>15%</td> </tr> <tr class=\"alt-row\"> <td>Journal Article</td> <td>20%</td> </tr> <tr class=\"row\"> <td>Technical Report</td> <td>25%</td> </tr> <tr class=\"alt-row\"> <td>Final Exam Memo</td> <td>15%</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> </div> <br /> <p>Reports will be graded on the basis of 70% technical content, 20% organization and 10% style and mechanics.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Collaboration Policy</h2> <p>In preparing the reports, students are encouraged to <strong>discuss</strong> their results with their lab mates. <strong>Data and figures may be shared</strong> between students in their lab group for the purpose of preparing the report, provided <strong>proper acknowledgment</strong> is made in the reports.</p> <p><strong>All writing in 3.014 must be original</strong>. Students should not copy any portion of their laboratory reports from reference materials or the reports of other students. Students should <strong>not</strong> use reports from previous years or their lab mates' reports in preparing their own reports. 3.014 has a zero tolerance policy on plagiarism. Any student caught plagiarizing will receive a grade of zero on the assignment and be taken to the Committee on Discipline (COD) for disciplinary action.</p> <p>Students are responsible for knowing what acts constitute plagiarism. If they have any doubt about how/when to properly cite or use a source, they should contact Professor Stellacci to obtain clarification.</p> <div class=\"help slide-bottom\"> <div class=\"help-message\"> <a class=\"help-engage\" href=\"javascript: trackEvents('Bottom Get Started','bottom get started Click','Help Overlay');\">Need help getting started?</a> <a href=\"javascript:disableHelpPopup(); trackEvents('Bottom Don\\'t Show','bottom don\\'t show Click','Help Overlay');\" class=\"help-dismiss\">Don't show me this again</a> </div> </div> <div class=\"help popup-center\"> <div class=\"help-message\"> <p class=\"help-dismiss\"><a href=\"javascript:disableHelpPopup(); trackEvents('Popup Don\\'t Show','popup don\\'t show Click','Help Overlay');\">Don't show me this again</a></p> <h2>Welcome!</h2> <p>This is one of over 2,200 courses on OCW.

It is a challenging and diverse enterprise - obtaining expertise in a large set of diverse subjects - but a career devoted to diverse study and applications will be very rewarding and fulfilling.</p><p>Mathematics is the <strong>language</strong> that binds together disparate topics in physics, engineering, and chemistry. While it is possible to become an excellent materials scientist and engineer without some working knowledge of a large subset of mathematical topics, it is much easier to master this discipline with mathematics to guide you. Through mathematics, you will discover that some topics have similarities that are not obvious-and not taught to you as being similar. Such similarities and analogies will make learning much, much easier - and I think much more enjoyable.</p><p>MIT's Department of Materials Science and Engineering has determined that students benefit from a background and a working knowledge of many more mathematics topics that pertain specifically to MS&amp;E than are taught in a one-semester subject in the mathematics department. It is reasonable to ask, &quot;Is this subject a substitute for a mathematics subject such as linear algebra or partial differential equations taught by a mathematics professor as part of the mathematics department?&quot; No, this is not a replacement for such a subject and I encourage you to take subjects in mathematics in the future. This subject is designed to be very broad in scope and therefore its depth in any one topic is limited.</p><p>I do believe very strongly that you will enjoy studying math more after taking this introduction and that the mathematical background you will receive this semester will make your materials science education richer and more rewarding.</p><p>I have designed this subject to help you learn as much essential mathematics as possible in a short time. To this end, this subject has several unusual aspects that you will need to know.</p><h2 class=\"subhead\">Mathematical Software</h2><p>Symbolic mathematical computer software is a tool used by almost every applied scientist. Such software helps produce results quickly, visualizes and documents the results, and minimizes the silly errors that creep into complicated mathematical manipulations. Although there are many other good choices, I have decided to use MathematicaÂ® as a vehicle for learning and doing mathematics. It has a fairly steep learning curve, but it probably repays the time investment with powerful (once learned) language syntax and packages. Such symbolic mathematical software is an aid to help you think about and perform mathematics - it is not a replacement for mathematical understanding.</p><p>MathematicaÂ® is available for all MIT students, both on the MIT server workstations (free) and via licenses for personal laptop and desktop machines ($30 for students, a useful investment for other subjects). You will need MathematicaÂ® for your first homework set and laboratory; you should try to get it working someplace very soon. If you have a laptop, I suggest that you install MathematicaÂ® on it as soon as possible.</p><p>Homeworks and lab reports will be turned in as MathematicaÂ® notebooks, by mailing to the instructor and the TA.</p><p>Laboratory assignments must be completed during the laboratory period, and the resulting MathematicaÂ® notebook should be emailed to the instructor and the TA.</p><h2 class=\"subhead\">Examination Philosophy</h2><p>Tests and exams are powerful motivators to get students to take a subject seriously but I think that working through homework problems better promotes learning, particularly for self-motivated students.</p><p>Therefore, there will be no exams, tests, or quizzes in 3.016. Your entire grade will be based on your homeworks and laboratories. These will graded carefully (described below) and there will be about one homework set per week while the subject is meeting (i.e., no homework will be assigned during the weeks that the laboratory <a href=\"/courses/materials-science-and-engineering/3-014-materials-laboratory-fall-2006/index.htm\">3.014</a> meets).</p><h2 class=\"subhead\">Homework</h2><p>Of course when you do homework, you are not under the potentially menacing eyes of an exam proctor. This means that you can receive help in the form of:</p><h3 class=\"subsubhead\">Books</h3><p>Go to the library and find solutions to problems. It is good practice and you will learn quite a bit by doing so. I recommend that you attempt to find a solution before going to the library - not only will it help you appreciate the solution, it will also make your search a bit easier!</p><h3 class=\"subsubhead\">Experts</h3><p>By all means, consult with experts on your homework. It is a good idea as long as you understand what you turn in.</p><h3 class=\"subsubhead\">Classmates</h3><p>This is the best choice of all. I think it is both inevitable and beneficial to give and receive help. Cooperating on homework will help you learn to communicate your ideas and begin to appreciate the difficulties and rewards of teamwork.</p><p>As explained below, the homework assignments in 3.016 will be, in part, cooperative.</p><p>You will find that you are more busy some weeks than others and relying on a classmate during a busy week can be a life-saver. However, if you start slacking off and don't hold up your end of the bargain when you are able, you will engender resentment and endanger professional and friendly relationships. I leave it to your own conscience to play fairly and contribute when you can - and, while understanding that everyone experiences different kinds of pressures, to be forthright and honest with others who do not contribute consistently.</p><p>Homework cooperation has a potential downside because you all receive individual grades. We will attempt to mitigate this downside by dividing the homework into two parts:</p><h3 class=\"subsubhead\">Group</h3><p>For each homework set, a few problems will be designated as <strong>Group Exercises</strong>. For these problems, the entire group will turn in one <strong>homework</strong>. Every member of the group will receive exactly the same credit for the homework grade.</p><p>Homework groups will be assigned with each homework set. The groups will change from week to week and the members will be assigned randomly. Each group will be assigned a homework leader who will be responsible for arranging meetings and turning in the homework.</p><h3 class=\"subsubhead\">Individual</h3><p>Each problem set will contain a few problems for each student to complete individually. These problems will come out of the textbook and tend to be a bit easier than the group exercises. They are designed to maintain a sufficient amount of currency and emphasize that reading the textbook is an essential part of this course.</p><h2 class=\"subhead\">Laboratory</h2><p>There will be a laboratory each week that 3.016 meets. The labs will be practical and focused on using MathematicaÂ® effectively.</p><p>There will be assigned reading from the MathematicaÂ® help browser that comes with the software. <strong>You should always do this reading before the laboratory, or you may not be able to finish your assignment and turn it in before the end of the laboratory in order to get credit</strong>.</p><p>If you stay current in the course material and do the homeworks, you should have no difficulty doing the laboratory assignments if you do the pre-assigned reading.</p><p>It is not necessary, but if you have your own laptop running MathematicaÂ®, it will be helpful to bring it to the lab with you.</p><h2 class=\"subhead\">Grades</h2><p>As stated above, all of the final grade will depend on the homeworks and the laboratory assignments. There is no fixed average grade for this course; the average will depend on the entire class performance. However, if your homework grades and your laboratory reports are consistently within the top quartile, then it is extremely likely that you will receive an <strong>A</strong>. Homeworks will be graded by ranking them in order from <strong>Best Homework to Least Best Homework</strong>. A decision will be made regarding how many points (out of a possible 100) the <strong>Least Best Homework</strong> deserves, and the homework scores will be interpolated between a score of 99 for the <strong>Best Homework</strong> and that of the <strong>Least Best</strong>.</p><p>Homeworks will be evaluated on the basis of:</p><h3 class=\"subsubhead\">Accuracy</h3><p>The solution must be a reasonable and correct answer to the homework question.</p><h3 class=\"subsubhead\">Exposition</h3><p>The solution must clearly show the reasoning that was utilized to find it and the method of solution should be clearly apparent. Exegetic solutions will be ranked higher.</p><h3 class=\"subsubhead\">Beauty</h3><p>Good solutions will often require graphics and, with care, graphics can often beautifully explain the solution. The layout of the page, the quality of the supporting prose, the clarity of the graphics, and all that &quot;je ne sais quoi&quot; is fairly subjective but very important. The reader will include a judgment of your art in the ranking of homeworks.</p><h3 class=\"subsubhead\">Observation</h3><p>Supplemental observations provide aids in understanding and demonstrate mastery of a topic. An example of a supplemental observation might be something like, &quot;Note that in the limit of long times, that the total concentration goes to zero. This is sensible because the boundary condition on mass flux is directed outward everywhere on the finite domain.&quot;</p><p>Not all homeworks are weighted equally - see the <a href=\"/courses/materials-science-and-engineering/3-016-mathematics-for-materials-scientists-and-engineers-fall-2005/assignments\">assignments</a> page for more detail. Note that there will be times when you have two homework sets pending - this is done so that you can arrange your time conveniently.</p><p>Laboratories will be graded on their completeness, demonstrated mastery of MathematicaÂ® for that assignment, and exposition.</p><h2 class=\"subhead\">Late Policy</h2><p>Students will be allowed to turn in one homework up to 3 days late, for the individual portion only. No second late homework will be allowed without formal documentation about an unforeseeable emergency. No late group homework portions will be accepted - no exceptions.</p><p>Laboratory assignments must be turned in during the laboratory period. You must show documentation of unforeseeable emergencies that prevent you from attending a laboratory period. Any missed laboratories must be made up by special arrangement. If for some reason, you cannot complete a laboratory during the laboratory period, you should send a paragraph explaining why you could not finish.</p><h2 class=\"subhead\">Textbooks</h2><p>We will use a fairly general textbook on applied mathematics:</p><p><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0471333751/ref=nosim/mitopencourse-20\"><img border=\"0\" alt=\"Buy at Amazon\" align=\"absMiddle\" src=\"/images/a_logo_17.gif\" /></a> Kreyszig, E. <em>Advanced Engineering Mathematics</em>. 8th ed. New York, NY: J.W. Wiley &amp; Sons, 1999. ISBN: 9780471333753.</p><p>You'll notice that reading assignments do not follow the table of contents - while I like the book, there are pedagogical reasons for studying mathematics in the sequence we will follow in this subject. Extra material pertaining to materials science specifically will also be provided.</p><p>I have identified 66 sections of the book (330 pages among the book's 1200 total pages) as required reading. The readings for each lecture will appear in the Lecture Notes. I hope you will keep up with the reading - I think it would be wise to give the material a cursory reading prior to the lecture and then read it more carefully before starting the homework.</p><p>We will also use this textbook's MathematicaÂ® supplement:</p><p><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0471386693/ref=nosim/mitopencourse-20\"><img border=\"0\" alt=\"Buy at Amazon\" align=\"absMiddle\" src=\"/images/a_logo_17.gif\" /></a> Kreyszig, Erwin, and E. J. Norminton. <em>Advanced Engineering Mathematics: MathematicaÂ® Computer Manual</em>. 8th ed. New York, NY: J. Wiley &amp; Sons, 2001. ISBN: 9780471386698.</p><p>This course is designated as a 12 (3-1-8) unit subject (Units at MIT are assigned under the following schema lec-lab-out where lec is the number of lecture/recitation hours, lab is the number of laboratory hours, and out is the number of outside (reading, preparation, homework) hours per week. One MIT unit represents about 14 hours of semester work on the average.). Time spent awake at lectures and recitations is less than half of your job - reading and doing homework is the greater part.</p><h2 class=\"subhead\">Lecture Notes</h2><p>Lecture notes will be available for you to print out for each lecture. These will supplement (not replace) the textbook. The lecture notes also serve as a guide to help the student understand what parts of the text are considered more relevant or important.</p><p>The specific purpose of the notes is to provide neatly typeset equations and graphics that will be used in the lecture along with a few observations. This will eliminate the time required to write and draw, perhaps a bit sloppily, for you in your notes and for me on the blackboard.</p><p>The lecture notes will have reading assignments printed at the beginning of each lecture.</p><p>Much of what is important is spoken by the lecturer (or in the form of welcome questions and points of clarification by the students) and some explanatory notes will be written upon the blackboard. Mixing projected displays of equations and graphs with blackboard writing will allow incremental adjustments to the best learning pace.</p><p>The notes will have places for you to fill in auxiliary discussion and explanation.</p><p>You can use these notes in several ways. You could print them out before lecture and write your own lecture notes directly during the lecture. You could take lecture notes on your own paper and then neatly copy them onto a printout later. You could print them before lecture and write on them rapidly and then copy - neatly and thoughtfully - notes onto a freshly printed set of lecture. I recommend the latter for effective learning and the creation of a set of notes that might provide future reference material - but do whatever works for you.</p><p>The lecture notes will also refer to MathematicaÂ® notebooks available in the <a href=\"/courses/materials-science-and-engineering/3-016-mathematics-for-materials-scientists-and-engineers-fall-2005/lecture-notes\">lecture notes</a> section for downloading. These notebooks will be used as MathematicaÂ® sessions during the lectures to illustrate specific points and provide examples for you to help solve homework problems.</p><p>References to MathematicaÂ® notebooks look like this:</p><p><img border=\"0\" alt=\"MathematicaÂ® example.\" src=\"/courses/materials-science-and-engineering/3-016-mathematics-for-materials-scientists-and-engineers-fall-2005/syllabus/mathematica_ref.jpg\" /></p><p class=\"caption\">MathematicaÂ® example.</p><p>They will serve as place-holders in the lecture note when we switch from chalkboard and/or projected display of the notes to a live MathematicaÂ® session.</p> <div class=\"help slide-bottom\"> <div class=\"help-message\"> <a class=\"help-engage\" href=\"javascript: trackEvents('Bottom Get Started','bottom get started Click','Help Overlay');\">Need help getting started?</a> <a href=\"javascript:disableHelpPopup(); trackEvents('Bottom Don\\'t Show','bottom don\\'t show Click','Help Overlay');\" class=\"help-dismiss\">Don't show me this again</a> </div> </div> <div class=\"help popup-center\"> <div class=\"help-message\"> <p class=\"help-dismiss\"><a href=\"javascript:disableHelpPopup(); trackEvents('Popup Don\\'t Show','popup don\\'t show Click','Help Overlay');\">Don't show me this again</a></p> <h2>Welcome!</h2> <p>This is one of over 2,200 courses on OCW.

We will cover elastic and plastic deformation, creep, and fracture of materials including crystalline and amorphous metals, ceramics, and (bio)polymers, and will focus on the design and processing of materials from the atomic to the macroscale to achieve desired mechanical behavior. Integrated laboratories provide the opportunity to explore these concepts through hands-on experiments including instrumentation of pressure vessels, visualization of atomistic deformation in bubble rafts, nanoindentation, and uniaxial mechanical testing, as well as writing assignments to communicate these findings to either general scientific or nontechnical audiences.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Laboratory Experiments</h2> <p>Labs are conducted in groups and written up individually. The first recitation will outline the lab activities and schedule in detail. In short, you will attend lab 9am-1pm on <strong>either</strong> Tuesday or Thursday of a given lab week, as indicated on the 3.032 calendar. You will attend recitation on the day (T or R) that you do not have lab that week.</p> <p>Lab 1: Stress transformations and pressure vessels</p> <p>Lab 2: Atomistic origin of elasticity</p> <p>Lab 3: Micro and nanoscale plasticity</p> <p>Lab 4: Uniaxial mechanical testing</p> <p>Please arrive promptly; late arrivals receive a zero for that lab. Due to class size, participation in the other Group's lab day is not a permissible means to make up a missed lab. Missed labs in the case of an emergency that is excused by the deans at Student Support Services will be accommodated with an alternative assignment from Prof. Vander Sande. Lab material will be included in the quizzes. In other words, don't miss lab. You will meet your lab TA at the first 3.032 recitation, and this person will be your TA for your lab group throughout the semester. As will be discussed at the first recitation, each lab includes a short quiz at the start of the session, and an independent assignment.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Textbooks</h2> <p>Required: 3.032 Course Reader, <em>Mechanical Behavior of Materials</em></p> <p>Recommended Supplementary*: <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0521846706/ref=nosim/mitopencourse-20\"><img alt=\"Buy at Amazon\" src=\"/images/a_logo_17.gif\" align=\"absMiddle\" border=\"0\" /></a> Hosford, W. F. <em>Mechanical Behavior of Materials</em>. New York, NY: Cambridge University Press, 2005. ISBN: 9780521846707.</p> <p>*Note: There are many texts that treat various aspects of mechanical behavior. However, these texts tend to treat <strong>either</strong> the mechanics or the materials perspectives well, rather than integrating the two. Your lecture notes provide this integration, and the Course Reader provides sufficient background material and worked examples from the &quot;best&quot; textbook for a specific topic. The Hosford text is recommended and heavily cited in the Course Reader, but is missing key material covered in the first third of the class.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Grading</h2> <div class=\"maintabletemplate\"> <table class=\"tablewidth50\" summary=\"See table caption for summary.\"> <caption class=\"invisible\">Grading criteria.</caption> <thead align=\"left\"> <tr> <th scope=\"col\">ACTIVITIES</th> <th scope=\"col\">PERCENTAGES</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody align=\"left\"> <tr class=\"row\"> <td>Three quizzes (15% each)</td> <td>45%</td> </tr> <tr class=\"alt-row\"> <td>Seven problem sets</td> <td>25%</td> </tr> <tr class=\"row\"> <td>Four labs</td> <td>30%</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> </div> <br /> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Academic Honesty</h2> <p>We encourage you to work together on problem sets and lab analysis/discussion.

Thus 3.042 is a single laboratory centered on materials processing and design that deals with all types of materials.</p> <p>As its name implies, the 3.042 Materials Project Laboratory involves working with such operations as investment casting of metals, injection molding of polymers, and sintering of ceramics. After all the abstraction and theory in the lecture part of the DMSE curriculum, many students have found this hands-on experience with materials to be very fun stuff - several have said that 3.042/3.082 was their favorite DMSE subject. The lab is more than operating processing equipment, however. It is intended also to emulate professional practice in materials engineering project management, with aspects of design, analysis, teamwork, literature and patent searching, Web creation and oral presentation, and more.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Academic Procedures</h2> <p>Regular laboratory hours are Tuesday/Thursday 2-5pm. Students are free to perform laboratory work whenever they wish, although safety rules prohibit doing laboratory work while alone.</p> <p>3.042 is one of DMSE's two communication-intensive; subjects (3.014 is the other), and student communication will be a substantial portion of the grade. Each team will develop a Web site containing the project's goals, background, results, conclusions, etc.; this site takes the place of the usual written report. It often works well to have each team member be responsible for one of the major Web pages (background, design, materials, processing). At the time of the final presentation on Thursday Week #14, the team will also have prepared a hallway display of their project, similar to those of earlier 3.042 teams which are to be found in various hallways around DMSE.</p> <p>The Web site will also contain a link to the team's electronic laboratory notebook, which will be kept current as the term progresses. The notebook will contain a concise but thorough description of each day's results and plans, along with data analyses and scanned-in pictures and graphs of important results. The notebook will also contain safety-related issues, such as MSDS's for each material used and safety protocols for each experimental procedure carried out by the team.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Scheduling</h2> <p>Staying on schedule is probably the most difficult aspect of 3.042, and as the end of the term approached almost all past teams have wished they'd worked faster and more efficiently at the first of the term. Teams have to delegate tasks to individual members and brainstorm continually about who's to do what next. Some dates to keep in mind, and to incorporate into your Gantt charts.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Calendar</h2> <div class=\"maintabletemplate\"><table summary=\"See table caption for summary.\" class=\"tablewidth75\"> <caption class=\"invisible\">Course calendar.</caption> <thead align=\"left\"> <tr> <th scope=\"col\">WEEK #</th> <th scope=\"col\">TOPICS</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody align=\"left\"> <tr class=\"row\"> <td>1</td> <td>Introductory lecture, lab tours, initial discussion/brainstorming of projects</td> </tr> <tr class=\"alt-row\"> <td>2</td> <td>Teams present brief overview of proposed projects</td> </tr> <tr class=\"row\"> <td>3</td> <td>Team Web site up with content</td> </tr> <tr class=\"alt-row\"> <td>4</td> <td>Formal design review</td> </tr> <tr class=\"row\"> <td>5-9</td> <td>Project teams present progress and plans</td> </tr> <tr class=\"alt-row\"> <td>10</td> <td>All teams showcase prototypes</td> </tr> <tr class=\"row\"> <td>14</td> <td>Final presentations, posters</td> </tr> </tbody> </table></div> <div class=\"help slide-bottom\"> <div class=\"help-message\"> <a class=\"help-engage\" href=\"javascript: trackEvents('Bottom Get Started','bottom get started Click','Help Overlay');\">Need help getting started?</a> <a href=\"javascript:disableHelpPopup(); trackEvents('Bottom Don\\'t Show','bottom don\\'t show Click','Help Overlay');\" class=\"help-dismiss\">Don't show me this again</a> </div> </div> <div class=\"help popup-center\"> <div class=\"help-message\"> <p class=\"help-dismiss\"><a href=\"javascript:disableHelpPopup(); trackEvents('Popup Don\\'t Show','popup don\\'t show Click','Help Overlay');\">Don't show me this again</a></p> <h2>Welcome!</h2> <p>This is one of over 2,200 courses on OCW.

At this level, mechanical properties are intimately related to chemistry, physics, and quantum mechanics. Most lectures will consist of a theoretical component that will then be compared to recent experimental data (case studies) in the literature. The course begins with a series of introductory lectures that describes the normal and lateral forces acting at the atomic scale. The following discussions include experimental techniques in high resolution force spectroscopy, atomistic aspects of adhesion, nanoindentation, molecular details of fracture, chemical force microscopy, elasticity of single macromolecular chains, intermolecular interactions in polymers, dynamic force spectroscopy, biomolecular bond strength measurements, and molecular motors.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Prerequisites</h2> <p>18.03 Differential Equations, 3.11 Mechanics of Materials (suggested) or permission of instructor.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">What Requirements Does this Course Satisfy?</h2> <p>Course 3 restricted elective (conditional that the student hasn't taken or plans to take 3 other course 3 restricted electives in macromolecules), restricted elective for the biomedical engineering (BME minor).</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Textbooks</h2> <p>There is no textbook for this course. Reading assignments are distributed to students in a class reader; supplementary papers are also suggested as additional study material.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Nanomechanics Podcasts</h2> <p>A collection of nanomechanics podcasts featuring scientists in discussion with MIT students will complement the class lecture sessions. Students are required to listen to these podcasts and review the associated papers.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Grading</h2> <div class=\"maintabletemplate\"> <table class=\"tablewidth50\" summary=\"See table caption for summary.\"> <caption class=\"invisible\">Grading criteria.</caption> <thead align=\"left\"> <tr> <th scope=\"col\">ACTIVITIES</th> <th scope=\"col\">PERCENTAGES</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody align=\"left\"> <tr class=\"row\"> <td>Midterm exam</td> <td>33%</td> </tr> <tr class=\"alt-row\"> <td>Final exam</td> <td>33%</td> </tr> <tr class=\"row\"> <td>6 assignments</td> <td>33%</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> </div> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Academic Honesty</h2> <p>All work turned in for credit - problem sets, exams, etc. - must be your own individual work unless specific instructions to the contrary have been given to you by the instructors. Group discussion of problem sets is allowed and encouraged, but the problems should then be worked out and written up on an individual basis. Turning in problems copied directly from bibles is cheating. During exams exchange of information with others is unacceptable.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Exams</h2> <p>A midterm and final exam will be given. The midterm will be one hour long and held during class one day after Lec #12, and the final will be held during the final examination period on the lectures detailed on the course calendar. Exams missed due to documented medical problems and other (very) exceptional circumstances will be made up either by oral or written examination on an individual basis. Exams are closed-book, although a single sheet of notes (front page only, 8-1/2 Ã 11 inches) will be allowed for each one. You may bring your formula sheet from the midterm to the final exam. Exams may include both analytical problems similar to those in the homework assignments, and also questions dealing with concepts discussed in class or included in the reading assignments. Keeping up with the reading and associated problems on a daily basis, and insuring that the various concepts are well understood, is certainly recommended.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Assignments</h2> <p>Assignments are due at midnight of the due date. Assignments will be given out one week prior to due date.

These outside hours will include a thorough reading of various sections of the McCrum text as assigned in the Schedule, and usually one engineering problem. The reading should be done before the next class meeting, and the problem should be turned in at the next class meeting as well. (Occasionally your personal schedule may force you to delay a day, but try to avoid this.) No penalty will be assessed for the occasional late submission. Grading will be based on the quality of the submitted problems, the vigor of your in-class discussion, the three quizzes, and the design you will present at the end of the term.</p><p>Each student will develop a design for a polymeric load-bearing article (Click here (<a href=\"/courses/materials-science-and-engineering/3-064-polymer-engineering-fall-2003/syllabus/latch_design.pdf\">PDF</a>) for an example design of a cupboard-door safety latch, such as would keep a toddler from getting at the cleaning fluids.) The design will culminate in an engineering drawing such as would be rendered with SolidWorks or AutoCAD , to include a specification of material and processing method. Materials selection calculations, stress analyses, etc., will be included in the design writeup. The design drawing will be imported into Microsoft PowerPoint or other presentation software, and presented to the class during session 38 and 39 respectively. You should be working toward this design during the entire term, and you should skim chapter 8 of McCrum early to get started.</p><p>Student collaboration on homework is permitted and encouraged, but all work to be submitted should then be worked out and written up on your own. Copying directly from &quot;bibles&quot; or other such sources is cheating, although studying prior solutions can be an effective learning aid. Common sense should be exercized in this. Computer solutions are encouraged when appropriate; Maple is excellent for many of the assigned problems.</p><p>There are no formal recitations, but you are encouraged to make frequent use of the Instructor's office hours for assistance or just informal discussion.</p> <div class=\"help slide-bottom\"> <div class=\"help-message\"> <a class=\"help-engage\" href=\"javascript: trackEvents('Bottom Get Started','bottom get started Click','Help Overlay');\">Need help getting started?</a> <a href=\"javascript:disableHelpPopup(); trackEvents('Bottom Don\\'t Show','bottom don\\'t show Click','Help Overlay');\" class=\"help-dismiss\">Don't show me this again</a> </div> </div> <div class=\"help popup-center\"> <div class=\"help-message\"> <p class=\"help-dismiss\"><a href=\"javascript:disableHelpPopup(); trackEvents('Popup Don\\'t Show','popup don\\'t show Click','Help Overlay');\">Don't show me this again</a></p> <h2>Welcome!</h2> <p>This is one of over 2,200 courses on OCW.

However, students can use any package that can run the models, with the understanding that support will be limited if the product is unfamiliar to the instructors.</p> <p>All software for the course will be provided in DOS/Wintel format, but students can process assignments on any computer system. Note that the MicrosoftÂ® Excel materials are readable across platforms.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Grading</h2> <p>Grades will be based on various assignments throughout the term. Their approximate weights are:</p> <div class=\"maintabletemplate\"> <table class=\"tablewidth50\" summary=\"See table caption for summary.\"> <caption class=\"invisible\">Course grading.</caption> <thead align=\"left\"> <tr> <th scope=\"col\">ACTIVITIES</th> <th scope=\"col\">PERCENTAGES</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody align=\"left\"> <tr class=\"row\"> <td>Problem Sets</td> <td>20%</td> </tr> <tr class=\"alt-row\"> <td>Mid-semester Quiz 1 - Engineering Economy</td> <td>15%</td> </tr> <tr class=\"row\"> <td>Mid-semester Quiz 2 - Material Selection and Cost Modeling</td> <td>15%</td> </tr> <tr class=\"alt-row\"> <td colspan=\"2\"><strong>Unit Projects</strong> </td><td style=\"display: none;\" io-table-normalizer=\"\"><strong>Unit Projects</strong> </td> </tr> <tr class=\"row\"> <td>Engineering Economy</td> <td>10%</td> </tr> <tr class=\"alt-row\"> <td>Materials Selection</td> <td>10%</td> </tr> <tr class=\"row\"> <td>Cost Modeling</td> <td>15%</td> </tr> <tr class=\"alt-row\"> <td>LCA (Integrative)</td> <td>15%</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> </div> <br /> <p>The final grade will be modulated by an appreciation of the participant's progress throughout the semester, giving extra weight to those that finish strongly and demonstrate that they have mastered the material, in the end.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Course Policies</h2> <h3 class=\"subsubhead\">Absences</h3> <p>Students are expected to complete all assignments on time.

These items range from small pottery vessels for household use to monumental concrete structures like the Roman Coliseum. The technologies behind such transformations, which today might be called materials processing or materials engineering, will receive primary attention. Our focus will be on materials technologies of pre-modern peoples - with examples from societies known historically or from prehistory - and our methodologies will include those of the archaeologist, historian, and materials scientist. The aim is to reveal the complex sets of interactions of materials engineering technologies with other spheres of culture and to recognize the extent to which such technologies reflect, shape or modify the social dynamics in which they develop. Since such evaluations can be made only through in-depth appreciation of the engineering involved together with an equally sophisticated understanding of the social system, we will study materials both as cultural features and as physical matter.</p> <p>One of the most intriguing aspects of materials processing has to do with the criteria people use when selecting materials for specific purposes and how they develop certain properties of those materials to the exclusion of others. We tend to think that societies choose materials-metals, ceramics, fibers - according to their physical qualities such as mechanical performance, under a given set of conditions of use. Archaeologists and historians increasingly demonstrate, however, that the choice of materials and development of specific properties often have to do with ideological and aesthetic criteria or with the realm of social values. Frequently, it is the aesthetic play with a material and experimentation with the technology that provide individuals and groups with their knowledge of the materials, long before any scientific appreciation contributes to its improvements. We will pay particular attention to the relations among ideology, values, and materials development.</p> <p>In the first session, students will be introduced to the specific contributions that the approaches of anthropology/archaeology, history, and materials science can make to the understanding of materials technologies and how they developed. The archaeological approach will emphasize the role of the modern materials laboratory in artifact analysis and in interpreting the technologies ancient peoples used to manufacture the inventories of their material world. We will explore how much it is possible to infer about the technological behavior of prehistoric peoples on the basis of analytical studies.</p> <p>The design of the remainder of the subject rests on a case-study approach using three specific examples drawn from the prehistoric period and the pre-industrial era. Each case has been chosen to illustrate a different aspect of relations between the engineering of materials and factors related to social choice. The case studies include:</p> <ul> <li>Ancient glass</li> <li>Ancient Andean metallurgy</li> <li>Rubber processing in ancient Mesoamerica</li> </ul> <p>Each case will treat the fundamentals of the materials science and materials engineering involved, as well as the social circumstances surrounding the technological events.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Laboratory</h2> <p>Part of the exploration of the materials and engineering aspects of each case study will be accomplished through hands-on laboratory experience with the materials in question: glass, copper and its alloys, and rubber.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Field Trips</h2> <p>At least one field trip is planned for each of the case-study units. Details will follow.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Subject Requirements</h2> <h3 class=\"subsubhead\">Group Presentations</h3> <p>Students will be assigned to choose one material represented by each of the three case study groups: glass, metal, or rubber. Each group will research one aspect of the chosen material and make a group presentation at the end of the corresponding unit. Each student will be graded on his/her presentation, and the group will receive a group grade.</p> <h3 class=\"subsubhead\">Written Assignments</h3> <p>Each student will be responsible for two short papers on the material from the two units not included in his/her presentation. For example, if a student makes a presentation on metallurgy, the two papers will be on glass and rubber; if the presentation is on rubber processing, the papers will be on metallurgy and glass. We will assign the paper topics and help students with the structure and focus of the group presentations.</p> <h3 class=\"subsubhead\">Reading Assignments</h3> <p>Weekly reading assignments will be distributed from a selected bibliography.</p> <div class=\"help slide-bottom\"> <div class=\"help-message\"> <a class=\"help-engage\" href=\"javascript: trackEvents('Bottom Get Started','bottom get started Click','Help Overlay');\">Need help getting started?</a> <a href=\"javascript:disableHelpPopup(); trackEvents('Bottom Don\\'t Show','bottom don\\'t show Click','Help Overlay');\" class=\"help-dismiss\">Don't show me this again</a> </div> </div> <div class=\"help popup-center\"> <div class=\"help-message\"> <p class=\"help-dismiss\"><a href=\"javascript:disableHelpPopup(); trackEvents('Popup Don\\'t Show','popup don\\'t show Click','Help Overlay');\">Don't show me this again</a></p> <h2>Welcome!</h2> <p>This is one of over 2,200 courses on OCW.

Their subsistence depended on foraging for wild foods (often called &quot;hunting and gathering&quot;) and reciprocity of exchange. The total human population at 13,000 years bp (before present) has been estimated at about ten million. In the last 13,000 years the human population has increased several hundredfold, and numerous diverse complex societies characterized by food production (agriculture), permanent settlements, hierarchically ranked social structures, and redistributive economic systems developed in most parts of the Old and New Worlds. The attainment of this degree of complexity is often referred to as achieving &quot;civilization.&quot; The central theme of this class is the study of the processes leading to the earliest appearance of such societies in the Middle East/eastern Mediterranean region and Mesoamerica. We are interested in examining the similarity and difference in the trajectory of developments in these two regions to better understand the environmental contexts and the cultural processes involved with these changes.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Class Requirements and Mechanics</h2> <p>To fulfill the HASS-D requirements this subject includes two one hour lectures per week, one hour of recitation, and two hours of lab.</p> <p>The required written work includes three papers (ca. 7-8 pages each), a midterm examination and a final examination as scheduled below. Weekly lab exercises and problem sets will be assigned in conjunction with the labs. Attendance and participation in all class activities (lecture, recitation/discussion and lab) will be considered in evaluating your performance in this class.

The subject's scope encompasses our immediate pre-hominid ancestors of the Miocene, dating to between 6 and 22 million years ago, and all subsequent hominids including anatomically modern <em>Homo sapiens</em> who first appear within the past 150,000 years. The class charts hominid evolution from savanna/woodland dwelling primates with a distribution in tropical Africa to modern humans whose mental abilities and complex technology have enabled them to colonize all corners of the world. The class includes a survey of the late Pleistocene human cultural adaptations which formed the basis for the subsequent development of agricultural and pastoral based economies and urbanization which are the hallmarks of many human societies of the past 10,000 years. The subject concludes with discussion of modern human morphological variation and races.</p> <p>The subject integrates recent research in human palaeontology and archaeology to examine the interconnections between human physical and cultural development during the course of human evolution. Beginning with the Oligocene and Miocene primate substratum, the subject examines the five subsequent major stages of hominid evolution: 1) the earliest hominids (australopithecines), 2) the earliest <em>Homo</em>, 3) <em>Homo erectus</em>, 4) <em>Homo heidelbergensis</em> and <em>neanderthalensis</em>, and 5) modern <em>Homo sapiens</em>. For each stage a synopsis of the historical highlights of previous research will be presented, as will a description of the hard fossil evidence contributing to our knowledge of the hominid's physical form. The archaeological evidence for the cultural behavior (including symbolic behavior, subsistence patterns, and the level of technological capabilities) represented in each stage will be discussed using the format of mini-case studies using selected archaeological sites including Olduvai Gorge, East Turkana, Olorgesailie, Terra Amata, Dolni Vestonice and Abu Hureyra.</p> <p>By the very nature of the fossil and archaeological record the detailed history of human evolution can never be certainly known, but it is the subject's aim to provide students with an appreciation of what is reliably known (the &quot;facts&quot;) about human evolution, what must remain informed speculation, and what avenues still remain to be investigated.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Subject Mechanics</h2> <ol> <li>Two meetings per week: a combination of lectures, discussions, and practical handling of fossil casts and artifactual materials.</li> <li>Required work: includes a midterm exam, several short lab exercises, quizzes, two reading commentaries and two 4-5 page response papers, a group based presentation in class and a second midterm exam given during exam period.</li> </ol> <p><em>N.B.</em> attendance at lectures and participation in the discussions will be considered in evaluating your performance in this class.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Overall Weight of Assignments</h2> <div class=\"maintabletemplate\"> <table class=\"tablewidth50\" summary=\"See table caption for summary.\"> <caption class=\"invisible\">Grading criteria.</caption> <thead align=\"left\"> <tr> <th scope=\"col\">ACTIVITIES</th> <th scope=\"col\">PERCENTAGES</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody align=\"left\"> <tr class=\"row\"> <td>Reading Response - Waal and Mitani <em>et al</em> Papers (3 Pages)</td> <td>6%</td> </tr> <tr class=\"alt-row\"> <td>Osteology Quiz</td> <td>5%</td> </tr> <tr class=\"row\"> <td>Early Hominid Variation Discussion</td> <td>12%</td> </tr> <tr class=\"alt-row\"> <td>Isaac / Lovejoy / Bingham Reading Discussion (4-5 Pages)</td> <td>11%</td> </tr> <tr class=\"row\"> <td>First Midterm Examination</td> <td>22%</td> </tr> <tr class=\"alt-row\"> <td>Shipman <em>et al</em> Reading - Logic Evaluation - 1 Page Outline</td> <td>4%</td> </tr> <tr class=\"row\"> <td>Binford - Mousterian Critique (4-5 Pages)</td> <td>11%</td> </tr> <tr class=\"alt-row\"> <td>Reading Response - Diamond / Molleson Papers (3 Pages)</td> <td>6%</td> </tr> <tr class=\"row\"> <td>Second Midterm Examination (Exam Period)</td> <td>23%</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> </div> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Calendar</h2> <div class=\"maintabletemplate\"> <table class=\"tablewidth3\" summary=\"See table caption for summary.\"> <caption class=\"invisible\">Course calendar.</caption> <thead align=\"left\"> <tr> <th scope=\"col\">SES #</th> <th scope=\"col\">TOPICS</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody align=\"left\"> <tr class=\"row\"> <td>1-2</td> <td>Introduction: The Search for Human Ancestors, Approaches to the Study of Human Evolution and an Introduction to Human Osteology</td> </tr> <tr class=\"alt-row\"> <td>3-4</td> <td>Evolutionary Processes and Time Scales</td> </tr> <tr class=\"row\"> <td>5</td> <td>Modern Primates and Their Relevance to Understanding Human Origins</td> </tr> <tr class=\"alt-row\"> <td>6</td> <td>Tertiary Higher Primates: Our Pre-Hominid Predecessors</td> </tr> <tr class=\"row\"> <td>7-8</td> <td>Earliest Hominids: The Australopithecines and Affines</td> </tr> <tr class=\"alt-row\"> <td>9</td> <td>Early Hominids - Variations and Taxonomy - Presentations</td> </tr> <tr class=\"row\"> <td>10</td> <td>Hominid / Human Origins: Hypotheses and Speculation</td> </tr> <tr class=\"alt-row\"> <td>11</td> <td>Early <em>Homo</em>: How Should <em>Homo</em> Be Defined?</td> </tr> <tr class=\"row\"> <td>12-13</td> <td>The Archaeology of the Early Hominids I: Olduvai Gorge and Koobi Fora</td> </tr> <tr class=\"alt-row\"> <td>14</td> <td>The Archaeology of the Early Hominids II: Interpreting Early Hominid Behavior and Current Research Directions</td> </tr> <tr class=\"row\"> <td>15</td> <td>Midterm Exam</td> </tr> <tr class=\"alt-row\"> <td>16</td> <td><em>Homo ergaster</em> and <em>erectus</em>: Emerging Modern Morphology</td> </tr> <tr class=\"row\"> <td>17</td> <td>Slowly Emerging Modern Behaviors: Early Stone Age / Lower Palaeolithic Age</td> </tr> <tr class=\"alt-row\"> <td>18</td> <td><em>Homo heidelbergensis</em> and <em>neanderthalensis</em> or Early &quot;Archaic&quot;

The level of treatment presumes familiarity with differential calculus as well as introductory atomic physics and quantum mechanics of solids. The course moves from observation to understanding of magnetic phenomena at increasing levels of sophistication. The characteristics of magnetic materials are treated in the context of related effects in other materials. For example, magnetic and electric polarization and susceptibility are treated in parallel; ferromagnetism is compared to ferroelectricity; the reasons for ferromagnetic spin alignment are contrasted with superconducting spin pairing; magnetic anisotropy and magnetostriction are compared with anisotropic electric polarization, electrostriction and piezoelectricity.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Readings</h2> <p>The text for the course is:</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0471155667/ref=nosim/mitopencourse-20\"><img alt=\"Buy at Amazon\" src=\"/images/a_logo_17.gif\" align=\"absMiddle\" border=\"0\" /></a> O'Handley, R.

ISBN: 9780471043720.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">What is the purpose of 3.53?</h2> <ul> <li>To teach the elements of electrochemical processing as they derive from electrochemical fundamentals.</li> <li>To interpret contemporary industrial practice in term of the relevant thermodynamics and kinetics.</li> </ul> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Outline</h2> <h3 class=\"subsubhead\">Unit 1: Equilibrium Electrochemistry or &quot;Ions in Solution&quot;</h3> <p>Thermodynamic and transport properties of electrolytes -- aqueous and molten; solution models: Debye-HÃ¼ckel (aqueous), Temkin (molten salts); electrode potentials (the underlying physics, i.e., electron excess or electron deficiency on the electrode); emf series (aqueous and molten salts); reference electrodes (thermodynamics [establishing the voltage value] and kinetics [their <em>iE</em> characteristic]). For this part of the course I draw on notes of my own that I have prepared from various sources.</p> <h3 class=\"subsubhead\">Unit 2: Electrochemical Kinetics or Rate Processes in Electrochemistry</h3> <p>Electrode-electrolyte interface, nature of the double layer; kinetics of electrode processes, competition between processes involving mass transport and interfacial processes such as charge transfer at the electrode/electrolyte interface; laboratory techniques to determine rate and mechanism: controlled E, controlled i, a.c. methods, i.e., a.c. voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, including the underlying electrical engineering -- namely construction of the equivalent circuit. We get into phasors and impedance plots in the complex plane, but in a manner that has some practical value -- data interpretation for process optimization, maybe even on-line control; stationary and rotating electrodes. This entire unit pretty much follows the text. We cover reasonably thoroughly almost everything in Chapters 3 through 9.</p> <h3 class=\"subsubhead\">Unit 3: Electrochemical Processing</h3> <p>Winning, refining, plating, synthesis; current efficiency, voltage efficiency, power efficiency; energy balances; materials issues and environmental issues; case studies on Hall cell electrolysis to produce aluminum and electrolytic production of magnesium by both the Dow process and the I.G. Farben process. In studying aluminum and electrolytic magnesium technologies we try to rationalize contemporary industrial practice in the light of what we have learned earlier in the semester. Includes consideration of the environmental issues as, for example, in the case of the quest for the carbon-free anode for the Hall process.</p> <h3 class=\"subsubhead\">Omissions</h3> <p>I do not have time to do everything. In the past, these topics were not covered directly, although much of what I teach supports the study of these as well: corrosion; solid electrolytes. This year, depending upon the particular interests of the students in the class, I'm hoping to say something about batteries and fuel cells.</p> <div class=\"help slide-bottom\"> <div class=\"help-message\"> <a class=\"help-engage\" href=\"javascript: trackEvents('Bottom Get Started','bottom get started Click','Help Overlay');\">Need help getting started?</a> <a href=\"javascript:disableHelpPopup(); trackEvents('Bottom Don\\'t Show','bottom don\\'t show Click','Help Overlay');\" class=\"help-dismiss\">Don't show me this again</a> </div> </div> <div class=\"help popup-center\"> <div class=\"help-message\"> <p class=\"help-dismiss\"><a href=\"javascript:disableHelpPopup(); trackEvents('Popup Don\\'t Show','popup don\\'t show Click','Help Overlay');\">Don't show me this again</a></p> <h2>Welcome!</h2> <p>This is one of over 2,200 courses on OCW.

Additional materials, updated as needed by Professor de Neufville, can be found there.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Important Notes</h2> <ul> <li>This course emphasizes the development of &quot;application portfolios&quot;. These assignments show how the course material applies to each student's own professional interests (see the <a href=\"/courses/engineering-systems-division/esd-71-engineering-systems-analysis-for-design-fall-2008/assignments\">assignments</a> section). Students have routinely incorporated these applications in their research, thesis, and professional presentations.</li> <li>The subject assumes that participants are competent in the material covered by ESD.70J, the 3-unit micro-subject that covers Excel spreadsheet analyses. Go to that site for a self-assessment of whether you need to audit that subject (experience indicates you probably do).</li> </ul> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Organization of Subject</h2> <p>This subject focuses on the flexible design of engineering systems. It recognizes that the future is necessarily uncertain, and that we need to deliver good value for the range of possible scenarios. Flexible designs enable system operators to adapt their project to future circumstances, to avoid downside risks and to take advantage of upside opportunities.</p> <p>Many researchers and practitioners believe that flexible design will revolutionize the way we develop and manage complex projects. Indeed, case studies indicate that the approach can improve expected performance by around 25 percent. These are significant opportunities.</p> <p>The course shows how design flexibility can substantially increase the expected value of a system. It presents an integrated approach that</p> <ul> <li>properly deals with evaluation over time in risky situations, and</li> <li>pinpoints the value of specific design elements.</li> </ul> <p>The course consists of 3 major blocks.</p> <h3 class=\"subsubhead\">Basics: Recognition of Uncertainty, Valuation Fundamentals, and Timing Issues</h3> <p>This introductory block establishes three fundamental issues and provides the economic motivation for flexibility in design:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Recognition of Uncertainty</strong> is the crucial starting point. The understanding that the future is uncertain and that we must design our systems to operate in many possible scenarios provides the motivation for making our systems adaptable, for building flexibility into them.</li> <li><strong>Valuation Fundamentals</strong> covers the main analytic and conceptual issues associated with the valuation long-term projects. Here, the primary concern is with the relative value of the projects over time.</li> <li><strong>Timing Issues</strong> discusses the design issues â principally economies of scale and learning curves â that affect the tradeoff between building larger projects initially versus developing systems incrementally over time.</li> </ul> <h3 class=\"subsubhead\">Uncertainty Modeling and Flexibility Valuation Methods</h3> <p>This is the core analytic section of the course. It presents Decision Analysis and Lattice Analysis as the two means to assess the value of flexibility in design. Both provide ways to think through the many ways in which scenarios will occur over time, and correspondingly how system developers can react effectively to these alternate futures. Decision Analysis makes is possible to look at more complex futures, while Lattice Analysis is computationally much more efficient. Analysts need to understand the relative merits of each approach and which to use when, either singly or in combination.</p> <p>This section builds upon the Monte Carlo simulation methods presented in the Excel mini-course (ESD.70J) given at the start of the semester.</p> <h3 class=\"subsubhead\">Flexibility Identification Methods &quot;in&quot; Systems</h3> <p>This section explores the question of how designers can identify the parts of the system that should be flexible. The issue is that any significant system could be flexible in many, many different ways and it is important to identify which elements might most effectively contribute to increasing the expected value of the overall system. This is a primary area of current research, and the course will showcase current and recent doctoral research and other projects at the forefront of the field.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Prerequisites</h2> <p>This subject builds upon a basic knowledge of calculus and probability.</p> <p>Students should be proficient in the use of spreadsheet programs at the level covered by ESD.70J, the 3-unit intensive short course designed to bring them up to speed in Excel. In general, everyone will benefit from participating in this offering.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Course Materials</h2> <p>The primary text for the class consists of draft chapters from the new text being written for the MIT Press. Prof. de Neufville will distribute these electronically throughout the semester.</p> <p>This material is supplemented by chapters from:</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0070163723/ref=nosim/mitopencourse-20\"><img align=\"absMiddle\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Buy at Amazon\" src=\"/images/a_logo_17.gif\" /></a> de Neufville, Richard. <em>Applied Systems Analysis</em>. New York, NY: McGraw-Hill, 1990. ISBN: 9780070163720.</p> <p>Extensive references and papers are available from the <a href=\"http://ardent.mit.edu/real_options/ROcse_MIT_latest/index.html\">course Web site</a>.</p> <p>All students will be expected to have an up-to-date full version of Excel. They may also want to try the following optional add-ins:</p> <p><strong>TreeAge Pro</strong> can be downloaded for a 21-day trial from: <a href=\"http://treeage-pro.software.informer.com/6.0/\">TreeAge Pro Trial Version Download</a>, and student licenses can be obtained from: <a href=\"https://www.treeage.com/shop/\">The TreeAge Software Store</a>.</p> <p><strong>Crystal Ball</strong> information is available here: <a href=\"http://www.oracle.com/industries/education/oracle-crystal-ball-classroom-edition.html\">Oracle Crystal Ball Classroom Edition</a>.</p> <p>Participants can view and download PDF copies of the PowerPoint slides on the course Web site. As the instructors routinely improve their presentations as the class proceeds, the Web versions of the slides change from time to time. Students may wish to verify that they have the latest version before downloading the slides for reference in class.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Recitations</h2> <p>There will be regular weekly problem-solving sessions. Prof. de Neufville will schedule these in consultation with the class during the opening session.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Assignments</h2> <p>The graded assignments for the class mainly involve the &quot;application portfolio&quot;. This is a collection of applications, on topics individually selected by each student, using the methods presented in class on an issue. This has two phases:</p> <ul> <li>Individual assignments throughout the semester.</li> <li>A final portfolio that builds upon the individual assignments and the feedback during the semester. It will present an integrated whole so that each student will each have a completed case study demonstrating how they can use design flexibility to increase the expected value of their systems.</li> </ul> <p>Ungraded problems drawn from the <em>Applied Systems Analysis</em> text are distributed throughout the semester. Students are advised to complete them as a way of insuring that they know how to complete the applications â and pass the tests! Solutions to these problems will be posted so that students can grade themselves and get immediate feedback.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Grading</h2> <p>Grades depend principally on the application portfolio and tests, but include an allowance for class participation. The approximate weights are:</p> <div class=\"maintabletemplate\"><table class=\"tablewidth50\" summary=\"See table caption for summary.\"> <caption class=\"invisible\">Grading criteria.</caption> <thead align=\"left\"> <tr> <th scope=\"col\">ACTIVITIES</th> <th scope=\"col\">PERCENTAGES</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody align=\"left\"> <tr class=\"row\"> <td>Individual and final application portfolio</td> <td>40%</td> </tr> <tr class=\"alt-row\"> <td>Class participation and graded assignments</td> <td>15%</td> </tr> <tr class=\"row\"> <td>Mid-semester quiz</td> <td>20%</td> </tr> <tr class=\"alt-row\"> <td>Final examination</td> <td>25%</td> </tr> </tbody> </table></div> <p> </p> <p>Students should complete assignments on time. The teaching assistant will mark down unexcused late assignments.</p> <p>The instructors will modulate the final grade in appreciation of the participant's progress throughout the semester. Those who finish strongly and demonstrate that they have, at the end, mastered the material will receive more credit for the final grades.</p> <p>Previous quizzes and exams are posted in the &quot;Exercises&quot; section of the Web page. They indicate the kind of questions likely to appear on future exams. However, their content may not match the current syllabus, which is evolving along with research advances.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Academic Honesty</h2> <p>To avoid confusion that might result from different expectations in other contexts or establishments, please note the standards that apply in this subject:</p> <ul> <li>Assignments turned in for grading must be done individually. The instructors understand that students will discuss the course and often learn best collectively. However, students should prepare their reports for each assignment individually, in their own format and words.</li> <li>Demonstrated evidence of copying (exactly the same presentation, same wording of sentences, etc.) will result in zeros for each paper with this evidence.</li> <li>Anyone found cheating in an examination (copying from another student or using unauthorized materials, etc.) will receive a zero for the event.</li> <li>Material copied from other sources (articles, reports, Web pages, etc) must be properly cited. Evidence that material has been taken from elsewhere without citation will be treated as plagiarism.</li> <li>Prof. de Neufville will place a note in the student record of each person associated with plagiarism or cheating. MIT views these infractions seriously and routinely expels students who seriously violate our academic standards.</li> </ul> <p>Any questions about this policy should be addressed to the instructors.</p> <div class=\"help slide-bottom\"> <div class=\"help-message\"> <a class=\"help-engage\" href=\"javascript: trackEvents('Bottom Get Started','bottom get started Click','Help Overlay');\">Need help getting started?</a> <a href=\"javascript:disableHelpPopup(); trackEvents('Bottom Don\\'t Show','bottom don\\'t show Click','Help Overlay');\" class=\"help-dismiss\">Don't show me this again</a> </div> </div> <div class=\"help popup-center\"> <div class=\"help-message\"> <p class=\"help-dismiss\"><a href=\"javascript:disableHelpPopup(); trackEvents('Popup Don\\'t Show','popup don\\'t show Click','Help Overlay');\">Don't show me this again</a></p> <h2>Welcome!</h2> <p>This is one of over 2,200 courses on OCW.

It is a &quot;core&quot; subject in the MIT interdepartmental Program in Polymer Science and Technology (PPST), and one of the elective subjects in the doctoral Bio - and Polymer Program of the Department of Materials Science and Engineering. 3.91 was developed originally by Prof. F. J. McGarry in the 1960's, and has been offered continually at MIT ever since. Prof. D. Roylance has co-taught the subject since the mid-1970's, and became the sole instructor with Prof. McGarry's retirement in June 2002.</p> <p>As its name implies, 3.91 is aimed at presenting the concepts underlying the response of polymeric materials to applied loads. These will include both the molecular mechanisms involved and the mathematical description of the relevant continuum mechanics. It is dominantly an &quot;engineering&quot; subject, but with an atomistic flavor. The subject content will follow approximately that of the Ward text:</p> <ul> <li>Polymer structure</li> <li>Deformation of elastic solids</li> <li>Rubber-like elasticity</li> <li>Linear viscoelasticity</li> <li>Composite materials and laminates</li> <li>Yield</li> <li>Fracture</li> </ul> <p>The subject carries 3-0-9 credit, so approximately three hours of outside work should follow each lecture hour. These outside hours will include a thorough reading of various sections of the Ward text or Roylance modules as assigned in the <a href=\"#Schedule\">Schedule</a>, and often one or more engineering problems. The reading assigned for a given day should be complete before class, and the assigned problem should be turned in at the next class meeting. (Occasionally your personal schedule may force you to delay a day or two, but try to avoid this.) No penalty will be assessed for the <strong>occasional</strong> one-day-late submission. Grading will be based on the quality of the submitted problems, the vigor of your in-class discussion, and the three quizzes.</p> <p>Student collaboration on homework is permitted and encouraged, but all work to be submitted should then be worked out and written up on your own. Copying from &quot;bibles&quot; or other such sources is cheating. Computer solutions are encouraged when appropriate; 'MapleÂ® and MATLABÂ®' are excellent for many of the assigned problems.</p> <p>There are no formal recitations, but you are encouraged to make frequent use of the Instructor's office hours for assistance or just informal discussion.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Textbooks</h2> <p><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/047149626X/ref=nosim/mitopencourse-20\"><img alt=\"Buy at Amazon\" src=\"/images/a_logo_17.gif\" align=\"absMiddle\" border=\"0\" /></a> Ward, I.

The prerequisites are high school algebra and trigonometry. Students may also receive credit for 18.01 by transferring credit from a comparable college course taken elsewhere, or by passing an advanced standing exam.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Course Goals</h2> <p>The basic objective of Calculus is to relate small-scale (differential) quantities to large-scale (integrated) quantities. This is accomplished by means of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus. Students should demonstrate an understanding of the integral as a cumulative sum, of the derivative as a rate of change, and of the inverse relationship between integration and differentiation.</p> <p>Students completing 18.01 can:</p> <ol> <li>Use both the definition of derivative as a limit and the rules of differentiation to differentiate functions.</li> <li>Sketch the graph of a function using asymptotes, critical points, and the derivative test for increasing/decreasing and concavity properties.</li> <li>Set up max/min problems and use differentiation to solve them.</li> <li>Set up related rates problems and use differentiation to solve them.</li> <li>Evaluate integrals by using the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus.</li> <li>Apply integration to compute areas and volumes by slicing, volumes of revolution, arclength, and surface areas of revolution.</li> <li>Evaluate integrals using techniques of integration, such as substitution, inverse substitution, partial fractions and integration by parts.</li> <li>Set up and solve first order differential equations using separation of variables.</li> <li>Use L'Hospital's rule.</li> <li>Determine convergence/divergence of improper integrals, and evaluate convergent improper integrals.</li> <li>Estimate and compare series and integrals to determine convergence.</li> <li>Find the Taylor series expansion of a function near a point, with emphasis on the first two or three terms.</li> </ol> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Textbook</h2> <p><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0070576424/ref=nosim/mitopencourse-20\"><img border=\"0\" align=\"absMiddle\" src=\"/images/a_logo_17.gif\" alt=\"Buy at Amazon\" /></a> Simmons, George F. <em>Calculus with Analytic Geometry</em>. 2nd ed.

You may turn in one problem set late with no penalty, provided you do so before solutions are given out. Partial credit may be awarded for subsequent late homework, but you must talk with your recitation instructor.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Exams</h2> <p>There will be four in-class 50 minute exams, and one 3 hour final exam.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Make-up Exams</h2> <p>If you miss or fail an exam, you may take a make-up exam at certain arranged times. You will be notified by e-mail soon after taking an exam if you have failed it, so that you can plan for the make-up. Make-ups for failed exams can boost your grade only up to the lowest passing score (C-), which will be announced. Make-ups for full credit are permitted with a medical excuse.

They are not a test and you are encouraged to talk to other students about difficult problems-after you have found them difficult. Talking about linear algebra is healthy. But you must write your own solutions.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Exams</h2> <p>There will be three one-hour exams at class times and a final exam.

It also has significant applications to other fields like analytic number theory.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Prerequisite</h2> <p>Analysis I (18.100B) or the equivalent.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Text</h2> <p><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0070006571/ref=nosim/mitopencourse-20\"><img align=\"absMiddle\" border=\"0\" src=\"/images/a_logo_17.gif\" alt=\"Buy at Amazon\" /></a> Ahlfors, Lars V. <em>Complex Analysis: An Introduction to the Theory of Analytic Functions of One Complex Variable</em>. 3rd ed. New York, NY: McGraw-Hill, 1979. ISBN: 9780070006577.</p> <p>This is a text with an attractive geometric flavor. I plan to cover most of the material up to p. 232, but will add two lectures devoted to a complete proof of the Prime Number Theorem, which fits very naturally in with the text material on the Riemann zeta function.</p> <p>In most of the lectures I will add some material not in the text, partly giving alternative proofs, and partly working through solutions of some of the more interesting problems. In Lec #2, 13, 14, 16, 19, 21, and 22 the treatment is really quite different from the corresponding material in the text. Lec #21 and 22 actually contain a complete proof of the Prime Number Theorem.</p> <p>Since the lectures deviate so much from the text, regular attendance is strongly recommended.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Homework Assignments</h2> <p>Given out every other Thursday, due the next Thursday. This will be selected from problems in the text.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Exams</h2> <p>Two in-class tests following Lec #4 and 16. Also a final examination.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Grading</h2> <p>The final grade is based on a cumulative point total.</p> <div class=\"maintabletemplate\"><table summary=\"See table caption for summary.\" class=\"tablewidth50\"> <caption class=\"invisible\">Grading criteria.</caption> <thead align=\"left\"> <tr> <th scope=\"col\">ACTIVITIES</th> <th scope=\"col\">PERCENTAGES</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody align=\"left\"> <tr class=\"row\"> <td>Homework</td> <td>10%</td> </tr> <tr class=\"alt-row\"> <td>Two in-class tests (20% each)</td> <td>40%</td> </tr> <tr class=\"row\"> <td>Final exam</td> <td>50%</td> </tr> </tbody> </table></div> <p> </p><h2 class=\"subhead\">General Remarks</h2> <p class=\"maintabletemplate\">Working on the homework problems is very important for your understanding and command of the subject. Be sure you allow plenty of time for this. It is ok for you to discuss the problems with another student but you must give your own exposition of the solution. In the process you will often be lead to a better solution. It is very important to do this exposition in a neat fashion. This is the right place for you to develop a clear mathematical writing style. (Tex is of course most welcome). Sloppy homework might not be accepted.</p> <p class=\"maintabletemplate\">There are dozens of books available on the topic of complex variables. I urge you strongly to browse in some of these in the library. Caratheodory's books <em>Theory of Functions</em> Vol. I and II are closely related to our text. Also, I would particularly recommend PÃ³lya and SzegÃ¶: <em>Problems and Theorems in Analysis</em>. Several chapters there deal with the subject of complex variables. Rudin's book, <em>Real and Complex Analysis</em> is also a valuable reference.</p> <p class=\"maintabletemplate\"><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0821828312/ref=nosim/mitopencourse-20\"><img align=\"absMiddle\" border=\"0\" src=\"/images/a_logo_17.gif\" alt=\"Buy at Amazon\" /></a> CaratheÃ³dory, Constantin. <em>Theory of Functions of a Complex Variable</em>.

This background is essential both for the knowledge of the subject matter and for the experience in formulating proofs.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Textbook</h2> <p>The text for the course is: <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0131816292/ref=nosim/mitopencourse-20\"><img border=\"0\" align=\"absmiddle\" src=\"/images/a_logo_17.gif\" alt=\"Buy at Amazon\" /></a> Munkres, James R. <em>Topology.</em> 2nd ed. Upper Saddle River, NJ: Prentice-Hall, 28 December 1999. ISBN: 0131816292. An errata sheet (<a href=\"/courses/mathematics/18-901-introduction-to-topology-fall-2004/syllabus/erratafortop.pdf\">PDF</a>) is available.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Expectations</h2> <p>You are expected of course to read the text and to listen to the lectures. But one does not learn mathematics by reading or listening or taking notes or memorizing proofs. One learns mathematics by doing mathematics. In your case, that means working on the exercises that will be assigned to accompany each lecture. Once a week, we will discuss in class those exercises that anyone wishes to ask about. This session is actually more important than the formal lectures, since it will deal with material that cannot be found in the text.</p> <p>Your goal should be to construct a notebook containing written-out solutions to all the assigned exercises. Whether you found the solution yourself, or worked it out in collaboration with others, or wrote it up after the class discussion, does not matter. What matters is that you went through the process of writing it out and understanding it. This process is essential, for that is how one finds his or her errors or gaps in reasoning (as any graduate student writing a thesis can testify).</p> <p>These exercises are not to be handed in for grading. Instead, your knowledge of the exercises will be determined by the exams, which will be based almost entirely on the exercises. I guarantee that the exams will do a good job of determining to what extent you have mastered the exercises.</p> <p>Besides the exercises, there will be four formal problem sets during the term. The solutions are to be written out, in good mathematical style, to be handed in and graded. (We make some comments about mathematical style in the <a href=\"/courses/mathematics/18-901-introduction-to-topology-fall-2004/assignments\">assignments</a> section.) The work on the problem sets is to be strictly your own - think of them as take-home exams. They are intended to challenge you to think about problems that are a bit less routine than regular ones, and to give you some practice in writing mathematics acceptably.</p> <p>There will also be two informal, optional problem sets, one at the beginning and one at the end of the term.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Grading</h2> <p>Grading will be as follows:</p> <div class=\"maintabletemplate\"><table summary=\"See table caption for summary.\" class=\"tablewidth50\"> <caption class=\"invisible\">Grading Table</caption> <thead align=\"left\"> <tr class=\"tableheader\"> <th abbr=\"Week Number\" scope=\"col\" id=\"col1\">ACTIVITIES</th> <th scope=\"col\" id=\"col2\">POINTS</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody align=\"left\"> <tr class=\"row\"> <td headers=\"col1\">Problem Sets</td> <td headers=\"col2\">400</td> </tr> <tr class=\"alt-row\"> <td headers=\"col1\">Midterm Exam</td> <td headers=\"col2\">100</td> </tr> <tr class=\"row\"> <td headers=\"col1\">Final Exam</td> <td headers=\"col2\">200</td> </tr> <tr class=\"alt-row\"> <td headers=\"col1\">Total</td> <td headers=\"col2\">700</td> </tr> </tbody> </table></div> <div class=\"help slide-bottom\"> <div class=\"help-message\"> <a class=\"help-engage\" href=\"javascript: trackEvents('Bottom Get Started','bottom get started Click','Help Overlay');\">Need help getting started?</a> <a href=\"javascript:disableHelpPopup(); trackEvents('Bottom Don\\'t Show','bottom don\\'t show Click','Help Overlay');\" class=\"help-dismiss\">Don't show me this again</a> </div> </div> <div class=\"help popup-center\"> <div class=\"help-message\"> <p class=\"help-dismiss\"><a href=\"javascript:disableHelpPopup(); trackEvents('Popup Don\\'t Show','popup don\\'t show Click','Help Overlay');\">Don't show me this again</a></p> <h2>Welcome!</h2> <p>This is one of over 2,200 courses on OCW.

The discussions did not cover all the topics in the chapter. Rather, they aimed to communicate the basics and make it easier for the students to read the materials in these chapters on their own. While these materials were not tested in the exams, they are fundamental and it is important for the students to learn them well. It was not a requirement for students to hand in the homeworks in the lectures, but students had to do as many as they could on their own.</p> <p>The following topics were covered in detail:</p> <ol> <li>Series solutions of linear homogeneous ODE. Discussed how to make expansions around irregular as well as regular singular points.<br /> <br /> </li> <li>The WKB Method. Covered not only the lowest-order WKB approximation but also the higher-order WKB approximations.<br /> <br /> </li> <li>Asymptotic expansion of integrals. Covered the Laplace method, the method of stationary phase, and the saddle point method.<br /> <br /> </li> <li>Boundary layer theory. Demonstrated how to solve the standard boundary layer problems. Discussed some of the boundary layer problems either considered unsolvable or solved incorrectly in the literature.<br /> <br /> </li> <li>Small non-linear oscillations. This includes the two-scale method, the counter term method in renormalized perturbation and the method of renormalization group.</li> </ol> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Prerequisites</h2> <p>Complex Variables with Applications (<a href=\"/courses/mathematics/18-04-complex-variables-with-applications-fall-1999/index.htm\">18.04</a>), or Advanced Calculus for Engineers (18.075) or Functions of a Complex Variable (18.112)</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\"><strong>Textbook</strong></h2> <p><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0975862502/ref=nosim/mitopencourse-20\"><img alt=\"Buy at Amazon\" src=\"/images/a_logo_17.gif\" align=\"absmiddle\" border=\"0\" /></a> Cheng, Hung. <em>Advanced Analytic Methods in Continuum Mathematics:</em> <em>Fundamentals for Science and Engineering.</em> Boston, MA: Luban Press, 2004.

Instead, we will cover computational methods combined with high-level algebraic techniques borrowed from solid-state quantum mechanics: linear algebra and eigensystems, group theory, Bloch's theorem and conservation laws, perturbation methods, and coupled-mode theories, to understand surprising optical phenomena from band gaps to slow light to nonlinear filters.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Prerequisites</h2> <p>Advanced Analytic Methods in Science and Engineering (18.305) or permission of instructor.

The collaboration policy on homework is as follows:</p> <p>First, talk to anyone you wish, and read anything you wish (with the exception of homework solutions from previous terms, which are strictly <strong>verboten</strong>). In fact, you are encouraged to discuss the course material and the homework problems with your classmates - often the best way to learn something is to force yourself to explain it to someone else. However, <strong>before</strong> you discuss a homework problem with a classmate or look for related information in some reference, you are expected to first make a solid effort at it on your own.</p> <p>Second, <strong>after</strong> you discuss a homework problem with a classmate or read related information in some other reference, you must write up the solution on your own, in your own words, starting from something close to a blank sheet of paper.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Exams</h2> <p>There is one midterm exam that covers the first half of the course. There is no final exam, but there is a final project due at the end of the course.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Project</h2> <p>Students must choose a published paper on an interesting photonic-crystal phenomenon, replicate the results of that paper using the MIT numerical software, and then extend the results in some interesting way.

Since some sections are shorter than others, some problem sets will be easier than others. Problem sets will be given out at the first lecture of a new section and will be due within a week of the last lecture of that section. Problem sets will be due no sooner than 3 classes after the class in which they are handed out.</p> <p>Each problem set will contain several easy problems and a few challenging ones (which will be marked with a '*'). If a problem set contains an extra-credit question, then this means I do not have a good answer and I would like to know if you do. You are expected to solve the easy problems and make progress on the challenging ones. Good answers on the extra-credit will endear you to me and might put +'s on your final grade.</p> <h3 class=\"subsubhead\">Group Work</h3> <p>Working in groups of two is encouraged, especially among students of different backgrounds (biology or computation). Each student will have to submit their own write-up of the solutions. Final projects can be done in larger groups if justified.</p> <h3 class=\"subsubhead\">Scribes and Editors</h3> <p>In addition to the problem sets, each student is responsible for scribing one lecture and editing one lecture. If you are interested in scribing specific topics, let us know by email, otherwise, volunteers will be chosen at the beginning of each lecture. It is thanks to the scribe and editor volunteers that lecture notes are made available online.</p> <h3 class=\"subsubhead\">Final Project</h3> <p>A final project is required of each student for them to get a good grade. The project can be studying a single paper in depth, implementing/extending an algorithm, or proving theoretical results on a problem of the student's choice. Topic for the final project should be set between the instructor and the student no later than drop date.</p> <div class=\"help slide-bottom\"> <div class=\"help-message\"> <a class=\"help-engage\" href=\"javascript: trackEvents('Bottom Get Started','bottom get started Click','Help Overlay');\">Need help getting started?</a> <a href=\"javascript:disableHelpPopup(); trackEvents('Bottom Don\\'t Show','bottom don\\'t show Click','Help Overlay');\" class=\"help-dismiss\">Don't show me this again</a> </div> </div> <div class=\"help popup-center\"> <div class=\"help-message\"> <p class=\"help-dismiss\"><a href=\"javascript:disableHelpPopup(); trackEvents('Popup Don\\'t Show','popup don\\'t show Click','Help Overlay');\">Don't show me this again</a></p> <h2>Welcome!</h2> <p>This is one of over 2,200 courses on OCW.

Though the theory of schemes and cohomology is generally accepted as the &quot;right&quot; setting for algebraic geometry, these subjects require a substantial amount of technical language which to the uninitiated can sometimes obscure the beauty and elegance of the subject. Thus in an effort to make the subject more accessible and to give students basic techniques without delving into a morass of technical details, I will not use this language in this course but rather the more classical language of varieties, which, though perhaps lacking the elegance of schemes, is perfectly adequate for many situations in algebraic geometry. Thus the goal of the course is more to give students a feeling for algebraic geometry, rather than to develop the foundations of the subject, which students should learn in subsequent courses on schemes.</p> <p>My plan is to follow somewhat loosely the first chapter of Mumford's book at the begining of the course, and then to discuss the appendix on curves and their Jacobians. Other topics may be included as time permits.</p> <p>Examples with emphasis on algebraic curves and surfaces are developed. The course may be taken concurrently with 18.705, Commutative Algebra. Knowledge of elementary algebraic topology and elementary differential geometry is recommended, but not required.</p> <div class=\"help slide-bottom\"> <div class=\"help-message\"> <a class=\"help-engage\" href=\"javascript: trackEvents('Bottom Get Started','bottom get started Click','Help Overlay');\">Need help getting started?</a> <a href=\"javascript:disableHelpPopup(); trackEvents('Bottom Don\\'t Show','bottom don\\'t show Click','Help Overlay');\" class=\"help-dismiss\">Don't show me this again</a> </div> </div> <div class=\"help popup-center\"> <div class=\"help-message\"> <p class=\"help-dismiss\"><a href=\"javascript:disableHelpPopup(); trackEvents('Popup Don\\'t Show','popup don\\'t show Click','Help Overlay');\">Don't show me this again</a></p> <h2>Welcome!</h2> <p>This is one of over 2,200 courses on OCW.

I'll introduce what I need as I go along, but possibly in a pretty loose way with a lot of assertions left as &quot;exercises for the listener.&quot;</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Overview</h2> <p>It is easiest to explain what 18.726 is about by contrasting it with 18.725. In 18.725, one studies algebraic geometry using powerful techniques but with a &quot;classical&quot; frame of reference set up in the early 20th century. In the 1960s, a school of mostly French mathematicians led by Grothendieck developed a new language and toolkit for dealing with algebro-geometric objects, centered around the notion of a scheme. The construction of a scheme is the algebraic geometry analogue of the construction of a manifold (or differentiable manifold, or...) by glueing together small easily understood pieces; working with schemes makes it possible to distinguish &quot;local&quot; and &quot;global&quot; phenomena as is typical in other types of modern geometry. The definition of an &quot;abstract algebraic variety&quot; from 18.725 approximates this, but the notion of a scheme is much more general and much more flexible; it correctly accounts for nilpotents (a big help to intersection theory), deals well with base fields which are not algebraically closed, and easily accommodates objects of number-theoretic interest (like the ring of rational integers).</p> <p>In some ways, this course is a language class: we will be learning how to read, write and speak the language of schemes. Along the way, we will absorb some of Grothendieck's insights into this language: the importance of working locally, the relevance of relative properties of morphisms, base change, and how to think algebraically about the cohomology of algebro-geometric objects.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Textbook</h2> <p><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0387902449/ref=nosim/mitopencourse-20\"><img alt=\"Buy at Amazon\" src=\"/images/a_logo_17.gif\" align=\"absMiddle\" border=\"0\" /></a> Hartshorne, Robin. <em>Algebraic Geometry</em>. New York, NY: Springer, 1997. ISBN: 9780387902449.</p> <p>This is required mostly because I will draw many of the homework problems from it.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Homework</h2> <p>Problem sets will be assigned each week, to be turned in the following week. Each problem set will involve doing a certain number of problems chosen from a larger set of offerings; students should choose what to submit based on their own background and interests. You should plan to spend a lot of time on the homework, since much of the challenge of this material is getting comfortable with the basic notions, and this is best achieved by grappling with them at close range.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Exams</h2> <p>There are no exams in this course.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Grading</h2> <p>The course grade will be based solely on the weekly problem sets.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Note for Undergraduates</h2> <p>This class is not particularly intended for undergraduates, and is not appropriate as a first course in algebraic geometry (remember that 18.725 and 18.705 are both prerequisites). Also, the time required to complete the homework in this class may seem large even compared to other graduate courses. However, undergraduates with adequate preparation can take this class.

The exponential mapping for a Lie group emerges as a special case. The relationship between Lie subgroups and Lie subalgebras via the exponential mapping will be developed in detail. Lie's three fundamental theorems relating <strong>all</strong> finite-dimensional Lie algebras with local Lie groups will be proved via Maurer-Cartan forms and the global version by means of the Levi-decomposition. We conclude with a study of invariant differential forms on Lie groups and coset spaces, ending with some results about cohomology of Lie groups.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Textbook</h2> <p><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0821828487/ref=nosim/mitopencourse-20\"><img alt=\"Buy at Amazon\" src=\"/images/a_logo_17.gif\" align=\"absmiddle\" border=\"0\" /></a> Helgason, Sigurdur. <a href=\"http://www.ams.org/bookstore?fn=20&amp;arg1=gsmseries&amp;item=GSM-34\"><em>Differential Geometry, Lie Groups, and Symmetric Spaces</em></a>.

There is also a bit of discussion of non-abelian equidistribution results, like the Chebotarev density theorem, and the Sato-Tate conjecture for elliptic curves (and recent progress on same by Clozel, Harris, Shepherd-Barron, Taylor).

There are one or two points where a little algebraic number theory (as in 18.786) may be helpful, but it is in no way required. On the other hand, the 18.112 prerequisite is quite serious; if you do not formally meet it, you must let me know in writing what your equivalent preparation is. Also recommended: some abstract algebra (18.701 and 18.702), though this will probably only make a real difference at the end of the semester.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Homework</h2> <p>There will be roughly weekly assignments throughout the semester.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Collaboration policy</h2> <p>You may (and should) work together on problems, but you must write up solutions individually, and you should indicate on your homework who you were working with. In case of ambiguity, I reserve the right to ask you to defend your solutions individually.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Exams</h2> <p>There are no exams in this class.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Grading</h2> <p>100% homework.

This course is an introduction to the product design process with a focus on designing for play and entertainment. At the end of the course, students present their toy products at the Playsentations to toy designers, engineers, elementary school children and the MIT community.</p> <p>In this course, students work in small teams of 5-6 members to design and prototype new toys. Students work closely with a local sponsor and experienced mentors on a themed toy design project. Students will be introduced to the product development process, including: determining customer needs; brainstorming; estimation; sketching; sketch modeling; concept development; design aesthetics; detailed design; prototyping; and written, visual, and oral communication.</p> <p>For additional information about this course, see the <a href=\"http://web.mit.edu/2.00b/www/index.html\">2.00B Web site</a> .</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Almost Required Readings</h2> <p><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/006097625X/ref=nosim/mitopencourse-20\"><img alt=\"Buy at Amazon\" src=\"/images/a_logo_17.gif\" align=\"absMiddle\" border=\"0\" /></a> McCloud, Scott. <em>Understanding Comics: The Invisible Art</em>.

Attendance during these sessions is <strong>mandatory</strong>. The recitation sections will consist of additional discussion of course material, examples and experiments. These sections serve three main purposes: (1) they provide a more informal opportunity to explore issues and ask questions about lectures, texts, or previously assigned material which requires clarification; (2) example problems will be presented and discussed, and (3) they provide opportunities to further explore course topics with experiments.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Prerequisites and Corequisites</h2> <p>Prerequisites:</p><ul><li><em>8.01 Physics I: Classical Mechanics</em></li><li><a href=\"/courses/mathematics/18-02sc-multivariable-calculus-fall-2010\"><em>18.02 Multivariable Calculus</em></a></li></ul> <p>Corequisites:</p><ul><li><a href=\"/courses/mathematics/18-03sc-differential-equations-fall-2011\"><em>18.03 Differential Equations</em></a></li></ul> <p>Prerequisites and Corequisites are strictly enforced.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Texts</h2> <h3 class=\"subsubhead\">Required</h3> <ol> <li><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/013191345X/ref=nosim/mitopencourse-20\"><img border=\"0\" align=\"absMiddle\" src=\"/images/a_logo_17.gif\" alt=\"Buy at Amazon\" /></a> Hibbeler, R.

To receive credit, problem sets must be handed in at the beginning of class on the due date. Problem sets will not necessarily be assigned every week because of tests, holidays, etc. <strong>Late problem sets will not be accepted. The lowest problem set grade will be dropped</strong>.</p> <p>You are welcome, and encouraged, to work on the assignment problems with fellow students. A good way to learn the material is in small study groups. Such groups work best if members have attempted the problems individually before meeting as a group. Of course, the assignment solution that you turn in should reflect your own understanding, and not that of your fellow students. In other words, do not copy directly from other students. If it is obvious that such direct copying has occurred, we will disallow that homework.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Tests</h2> <p>There will be two one and one-half hour quizzes and a three-hour final exam. These will be closed book. Two pages of notes (one-sided) are permitted for each quiz, four pages for the final.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Tutorials</h2> <p>The TAs will hold a tutorial session one or two days before each quiz.

ISBN: 9780471241980.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Prerequisites</h2> <p><a href=\"/courses/mechanical-engineering/2-001-mechanics-materials-i-fall-2006/index.htm\">2.001</a> Mechanics and Materials I</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Laboratory</h2> <p>The laboratory part of the course puts course material in to practice in (a) experimentally quantifying mechanical performance of structures, (b) determining material properties, (c) selecting appropriate materials for particular applications, and (d) project-mode exploration of mechanical behavior.</p> <p>The class will be divided into 3 sections of approximately 15 students each.</p> <p>The laboratory experience consists of six laboratory modules in the mode of focused two Â­hour &quot;recitations&quot; in mechanical behavior of materials <strong>coupled</strong> with small &quot;experimental projects,&quot; plus a multiple session &quot;term project&quot; in which small lab teams of 3Â­-4 students each will conduct independent experimental investigations into the mechanical behavior of engineering materials and structures. Team-based oral presentations of the term project will take place in the last week of labs.</p> <p>Handouts for each lab module will be distributed at lecture and placed on the course home page before the ï¬rst lab session of that module. <strong>Students are expected to have read the handÂ­out prior to lab</strong>. Each student should bring a calculator to the lab.</p> <p>After completing a given laboratory module, students will write up a concise, but complete, summary of the lab. At the following lab session, the write-up will be turned in to the laboratory instructor for grading, comments and observations; the graded write-up will be returned to the student at his/her next scheduled laboratory session. Policies regarding written laboratory reports will be explained in the ï¬rst laboratory session.</p> <p>Topics suitable for the term project vary broadly in nature, and can originate from a variety of sources. A handout with background information on a list of possible topics will be distributed later in the term; in addition, topic areas suggested by students and approved by the respective lab instructors are encouraged.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Homework Assignments</h2> <p>Homework Assignments will usually be handed out on Wednesdays. They will usually be due one week after they are handed out. To receive credit, you must hand in your solutions on the due date, at the beginning of class. <strong>No late homework will be accepted</strong>.</p> <p>Solutions to the assignments will normally be available in the Lab Instructor's office after 5 p.m. on the due date, and will be placed on the courseâs webpage. There will be exceptions to this pattern because of tests, Institute holidays, and so on. Graded homework will be available in the Lab Instructor's office approximately one week after the problem set is handed in. While we will make &quot;solutions&quot; to the homework available, the benefits which students obtain from their own prior efforts on an assignment will far exceed those obtainable from mere passive review of the efforts of others.</p> <p><strong>Note:</strong> We <strong>encourage</strong> students to work with each other on the homework assignments, but <strong>we do not condone copying</strong>. Make your own honest collaborative efforts to contribute to the solution (by asking questions, offering suggestions, etc.) and, based on your own understanding, write up the answers in your own words and style. If you worked closely with other students on a given homework assignment and feel that your understanding was substantially inï¬uenced by the mutual learning process, you should formally cite the names of those students with whom you worked.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Quizzes, MiniÂ­-Quizzes, and Final Examination</h2> <p>There will be two quizzes during the term, and a ï¬nal examination at the end of the semester. These will be <strong>closedÂ­ book</strong>. Students will prepare up to <strong>two (2)</strong> letterÂ­-size pages (2 sheets; 4 sides) of self Â­prepared, <strong>handwritten</strong> notes (no photo-Â­reductions) for use during each quiz; in addition, these notes will be submitted with the quiz for partial grade-Â­content of that quiz. Up to <strong>six</strong> (6) such pages (6 sheets; 12 sides) may be prepared for the Final Examination.</p> <p>Excused absences from taking quizzes at the scheduled times <strong>must be requested in advance of the quiz</strong> from Prof. Parks.

The homework and exams are closely related to the lecture sessions.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">&quot;Lecture&quot; Sessions</h2> <p>There are two 1.5 hour &quot;lecture&quot; sessions each week on Tuesdays and Thursdays from 11:00-12:30. The word &quot;lecture&quot; is in quotes because we do not intend for these sessions to be dominated by what you normally think of as lecturing. These &quot;lecture&quot; sessions are different from the lab times since we will all be together in the same room at the same time. The &quot;lecture&quot; sessions will be used to introduce new material, to amplify with examples, to do interactive exercises, and to provide feedback on homework assignments and exams. We expect you to be present at these sessions and to participate thoughtfully, but we will not take roll call or enforce attendance.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">&quot;Lab&quot; Sessions</h2> <p>You will be assigned to one 3 hour &quot;lab&quot; session each week. The word &quot;lab&quot; is in quotes because the session is a mix of fabrication, electronics, programming, experimentation, peer group meetings, and oral reports. These &quot;lab&quot; sessions vary to some degree from section-to section, but mostly follow a pattern described in a set of documents describing the deliverables and expectations for each week.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Course Objectives</h2> <p>In engineering design, it is helpful to give careful considerations to objectives and to the form in which they are expressed. To the extent possible, the learning objectives of this subject were developed following the guidelines articulated by Richard Felder<sup>1</sup> including use of action verbs and inclusion of objectives in levels 4-6 of Bloom's taxonomy of educational objectives (Table 1).</p> <p><strong>Table 1</strong>. Bloom's Taxonomy of Educational Objectives</p> <div class=\"maintabletemplate\"><table class=\"tablewidth50\" summary=\"See table caption for summary.\"> <caption class=\"invisible\">Educational objectives.</caption> <thead align=\"left\"> <tr> <th scope=\"col\">EDUCATIONAL OBJECTIVE</th> <th scope=\"col\">ASSOCIATED ACTION VERBS</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody align=\"left\"> <tr class=\"row\"> <td>6. Evaluation</td> <td>Judge, critique, justify</td> </tr> <tr class=\"alt-row\"> <td>5. Synthesis</td> <td>Design, invent, propose</td> </tr> <tr class=\"row\"> <td>4.

Comprehension</td> <td>Explain, paraphrase</td> </tr> <tr class=\"alt-row\"> <td>1. Knowledge</td> <td>List, recite</td> </tr> </tbody> </table></div> <p> </p><p>After taking this subject (2.007 - Design and Manufacturing I) students should be able to:</p> <ul> <li>Generate, analyze, and refine the design of electro-mechanical devices making use of physics and mathematics</li> <li>For common machine elements including fasteners, joints, springs, bearings, gearing, clutches, couplings, belts, chains, and shafts <ul> <li>Describe the function of the element</li> <li>List common uses in mechanical systems and give examples</li> <li>Analyze its performance and failure modes</li> <li>Describe how they are manufactured and the implications of the alternatives</li> <li>Select an element for a specific use based on information such as that typically available in a manufacturer's catalog</li> </ul></li> <li>Apply experimentation and data analytic principles relevant to mechanical design <ul> <li>Consider the effects of geometric variation on a design</li> <li>Analyze data from performance evaluations of a mechanical system</li> <li>Present data in appropriate graphical formats</li> <li>Plan an experimental investigation to refine a system</li> </ul></li> <li>Communicate a design and its analysis (written, oral, and graphical forms) <ul> <li>Read and interpret mechanical drawings of systems with moderate complexity</li> <li>Create correct mechanical drawings of simple elements and systems</li> <li>Create useful parametric solid models of simple elements and systems</li> <li>Make effective presentations in a design review format</li> <li>Respond effectively in real time to technical questioning by experts</li> </ul></li> </ul> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Notes on Submission of Work</h2> <p>The manner in which you present your work can be just as important (and in some cases more so) than the work itself. Be sure to clearly explain your designs, the methods used, and the underlying assumptions. Such practices make it possible for us to fairly assess your work and happen also to be good practices for documenting work in industry.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Late Policy</h2> <p>It is expected that completed assignments will be submitted on the due date and time noted on the assignment. The usual policy for late assignments is that a letter grade is lost per day late. If no arrangement is made ahead of time, that is going to be adhered to strictly. The teaching staff is well aware of the multiple time demands on students. In the case of unusual circumstances or <strong>unavoidable</strong> conflicts, please contact Prof. Dan Frey (for homework) or your section instructor (for lab work) to discuss the details and explore alternatives <strong>before</strong> the assignment is actually late.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Time Commitment and Expectations</h2> <p>The units on an MIT subject correspond to the time that an adequately prepared student is expected to spend in a normal week. This is divided into three numbers associated with the subject (X-Y-Z) with X being class time, Y being laboratory time, and Z being work outside of class. The numbers associated with 2.007 are (3-4-5) making this a 12-unit subject. Thus, the overall weekly time commitment is expected to be about 12 hours. This includes 3 hours per week scheduled in class and 4 hours per week in lab sessions (three scheduled hours and one hour &quot;self-paced&quot;). The 5 hours per week of out-of-class time will roughly be split between reading ahead for lecture, homework assignments, studying for exams, and (most importantly) working on your design project.</p> <p>This course will <strong>not</strong> be graded on a curve. In principle, <strong>everyone</strong> in the course <strong>can</strong> earn an A, but that is not usually what happens. Those who do only ordinary design work without accomplishing exceptional things should not expect to earn an A even if they do all the things assigned to them.</p> <p>All homeworks, exams, and other in-lab assignments will be graded on a letter basis (with +/-) according to the MIT definition of grades:</p> <blockquote dir=\"ltr\" style=\"MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px\"> <p>A - Exceptionally good performance, demonstrating a <strong>superior</strong> understanding of the subject matter, a foundation of extensive knowledge, and a skillful use of concepts and/or materials.</p> <p>B - Good performance, demonstrating capacity to use the appropriate concepts, a <strong>good</strong> understanding of the subject matter, and an ability to handle the problems and materials encountered in the subject.</p> <p>C - Adequate performance, demonstrating an <strong>adequate</strong> understanding of the subject matter, an ability to handle relatively simple problems, and adequate preparation for moving on to more advanced work in the field.</p> <p>D - Minimally acceptable performance, demonstrating at least <strong>partial familiarity</strong> with the subject matter and some capacity to deal with relatively simple problems, but also demonstrating deficiencies serious enough to make it inadvisable to proceed further in the field without additional work.</p> <p>F - Unsatisfactory performance.</p> </blockquote> <p>Plusses and minuses will be used in conjunction with the letters in grading all work. The final grade will include plusses and minuses.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Academic Honesty<sup>2</sup></h2> <p>The fundamental principle of academic integrity is that one must fairly represent the source of the intellectual content of the work one submits for credit. Students are trusted to adhere to this principle and its meaning in the context of this subject as subsequently explained. Official Institute policy regarding academic honesty can be found in the current Bulletin under &quot;Academic Procedures and Institute Regulations&quot;.</p> <p><strong>What is the policy on examinations?</strong> The examinations in this subject are to represent individual work. You may not receive any help from other students or any other individuals.</p> <p><strong>What about home assignments? Can we work together?</strong> We encourage students to work together in this subject to understand the homework assignments and to learn in general. There is much to be gained in sharing the learning process. However, the final submission should represent your own expression of the final response to the assignment and not a copy of someone else's expression thereof, whether directly from a person or as recorded on paper (e.g. a book) or electronically (e.g. on a Web site). Furthermore, you must fairly represent the authorship of the intellectual content of the work you submit for credit by acknowledging the contribution of sources (e.g., books, Web sites) you consult in the process of completing assignments. In addition, at the end of each assignment on which you collaborated with other students, you must cite the students and the interaction. The purpose of this is to acknowledge their contribution to your work. Some examples follow:</p> <ol> <li>You discuss concepts, approaches and methods which could be applied to a home assignment before starting your write-up. This process is encouraged. You are not required to make a written acknowledgment of this type of interaction.</li> <li>After working an assignment independently, you compare responses with another student which confirms your results and response. You should acknowledge that the other student's write-up was used to check your own. No credit will be lost if the response is correct, the acknowledgment is made, and no direct copying of the other response is involved.</li> <li>After working an assignment independently, you compare responses with another student which alerts you to an error in your own work which you then correct. You should state at the end of your submission that you corrected your error on the basis of checking responses with the other student. No credit will be lost if the response is correct, the acknowledgment is made, and no direct copying of the other response is involved.</li> <li>You and another student work through an assignment together exchanging ideas as the effort progresses. You both should state at the end of your individual submissions that you worked jointly. No credit will be lost if the responses are correct, the acknowledgment is made, and the assignment write-up is independent.</li> <li>You <strong>copy</strong> all or part of an assignment write-up <strong>from a reference</strong> such as a textbook or past solution (this is in contrast to <strong>referring</strong> to such a reference and developing the solution yourself). You must cite the reference. Partial credit will be given, since there is some educational value in reading and understanding the solution.</li> <li>You <strong>copy</strong> verbatim all or part of a write-up <strong>from another student</strong>. You must cite the person by name. Very little partial credit will be given.</li> <li><strong>Verbatim copying of any material which you submit for credit without reference to the source is considered to be academically dishonest.</strong></li> </ol> <p class=\"instruction\"><sup>1</sup> <a href=\"http://www4.ncsu.edu/unity/lockers/users/f/felder/public/Columns/Objectives.html\">http://www4.ncsu.edu/unity/lockers/users/f/felder/public/Columns/Objectives.html</a><br /> <sup>2</sup> This academic honesty policy is adapted from the policy used in 16.010-040 Unified Engineering</p> <div class=\"help slide-bottom\"> <div class=\"help-message\"> <a class=\"help-engage\" href=\"javascript: trackEvents('Bottom Get Started','bottom get started Click','Help Overlay');\">Need help getting started?</a> <a href=\"javascript:disableHelpPopup(); trackEvents('Bottom Don\\'t Show','bottom don\\'t show Click','Help Overlay');\" class=\"help-dismiss\">Don't show me this again</a> </div> </div> <div class=\"help popup-center\"> <div class=\"help-message\"> <p class=\"help-dismiss\"><a href=\"javascript:disableHelpPopup(); trackEvents('Popup Don\\'t Show','popup don\\'t show Click','Help Overlay');\">Don't show me this again</a></p> <h2>Welcome!</h2> <p>This is one of over 2,200 courses on OCW.

The challenge is to create a product that is responsive to the customer with high quality and low cost. A graduate of 2.008 should have the tools and confidence to go into a manufacturing enterprise that is using an unfamiliar process to make a product he/she has not seen, and yet be able to make intelligent decisions.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Scope</h2> <p>2.008 introduces you to modern manufacturing with four areas of emphasis: manufacturing processes, equipment/control, systems, and design for manufacturing. The course exposes you to integration of engineering and management disciplines for determining manufacturing rate, cost, quality and flexibility. Topics include process physics, equipment design and automation/control, quality, design for manufacturing, industrial management, and systems design and operation. Labs are integral parts of the course, and expose you to various manufacturing disciplines and practices.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Objectives</h2> <p>Internalize the attributes along which the success or failure of a manufacturing process, machine, or system will be measured: quality, cost, rate and flexibility.</p> <p>Provide exposure to a range of current industrial processes and practices used to manufacture products in high and low volumes. Focus in depth on a few selected processes.</p> <p>Apply physics to understand the factors that control the rate of production and influence the quality, cost and flexibility of processes.</p> <p>Understand the impact of manufacturing constraints on product design and process planning.</p> <p>Apply an understanding of variation to the factors that control the production rate and influence the quality, cost and flexibility of processes and systems.</p> <p>Understand the role of control in processes and systems, especially in view of the presence of noise (variation).</p> <p>Provide exposure to a range of manufacturing system constraints.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Instructors</h2> <p>Prof. Sang-Gook Kim</p> <p>Prof. Jung-Hoon Chun</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Credit and Workload</h2> <p>2.008 is a 12-unit subject. Each week, on the average, the course requires 3 hours of lecture, 5 hours of laboratory, group meetings and preparation for the laboratory, and 4 hours of study, homework and report writing. Six units may be applied to the General Institute Lab Requirement.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Lectures</h2> <p>Lectures are held on Monday and Wednesday from 12:30 pm to 1:55 pm.</p> <h3 class=\"subsubhead\">Lecture Schedule</h3> <p>Refer to the 2.008 Spring 04 Lecture and Lab Schedule.</p> <h3 class=\"subsubhead\">Textbook</h3> <p><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0201361310/ref=nosim/mitopencourse-20\"><img alt=\"Buy at Amazon\" src=\"/images/a_logo_17.gif\" align=\"absMiddle\" border=\"0\" /></a> Kalpakjian, S. <em>Manufacturing Engineering and Technology.</em> 4th ed.

If not, you may not be allowed into the lab.</p> <p>Lab sections are: Monday for 3 hours, Tuesday for 6 hours, Wednesday for 3 hours, Thursday for 6 hours.</p> <p>Section selection: You will be assigned to one of the lab sections during the first lecture. Because each section can accommodate only 12 students, some of you may be asked to move to another section. Every effort will be made to enroll you in a convenient section, but seniors will have priority.</p> <p>Lab attendance: Absolutely mandatory. You must arrive on time.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Grading Policy</h2> <p>Your grade will be based on your overall performance in class, labs, group meetings, and quizzes. They count approximately as follows:</p> <div class=\"maintabletemplate\"> <table class=\"tablewidth50\" summary=\"Course Table Listing\"> <thead align=\"left\"> <tr class=\"tableheader\"> <th id=\"col1\" scope=\"col\">ACTIVITIES</th> <th id=\"col2\" scope=\"col\">PERCENTAGES</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody align=\"left\"> <tr class=\"row\"> <td headers=\"col1\"> 2 Quizzes</td> <td headers=\"col2\">40%</td> </tr> <tr class=\"alt-row\"> <td headers=\"col1\">Lab Performance and Reports</td> <td headers=\"col2\">30%</td> </tr> <tr class=\"row\"> <td headers=\"col1\">Homework</td> <td headers=\"col2\">10%</td> </tr> <tr class=\"alt-row\"> <td headers=\"col1\">Group Meetings + Final Presentation</td> <td headers=\"col2\">20%</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> </div> <p>The quizzes are closed book and cover material from the lectures as well as the labs.</p> <p>Technical Instructors and TAs will grade your lab reports.

The analysis procedures are used extensively in the various fields of engineering and the sciences.</p> <p>Some strong reasons for taking this course:</p> <ul> <li>You learn modern analysis techniques used widely in engineering practice and the sciences, and you use these techniques in a general finite element program.</li> <li>You learn how to establish computational models of problems of solids and fluids, solve them on your laptop, and assess the accuracy of the results.</li> <li>You capitalize on your knowledge of mechanics, reinforce your knowledge, and solve problems that can only be tackled numerically on the computer.</li> </ul> <p>Great knowledge in your toolbox whatever your goals!</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Topics</h2> <ul> <li>Finite element analysis of solids, structures, fluid-flows, fluid-structure interactions, steady-state and transient problems.</li> <li>The finite element methods explained physically: why they work, what they can be used for.</li> <li>Modeling of problems, solution of response, how to check the results, how to assess the accuracy of the results.</li> <li>Use of a general finite element computer program.</li> </ul> <p>Hence in the course we focus on the actual analysis of problems, the physical explanation of the finite element methods, and the use of a general computer program. We shall consider solids and fluids and keep the theoretical discussions of finite element methods to a minimum.</p> <p>The methods studied in this course are practical procedures that are employed extensively in the mechanical, civil, ocean and aeronautical industries.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Textbook</h2> <p>You will find readings and references to special topics in the textbook.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0979004950/ref=nosim/mitopencourse-20\"><img border=\"0\" alt=\"Buy at Amazon\" src=\"/images/a_logo_17.gif\" /></a> Bathe, K. J. <em>Finite Element Procedures</em>. 2nd ed. Klaus-JÃ¼rgen Bathe, 2014. ISBN: 9780979004957.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Grades</h2> <p>The student's course grade will be based on:</p> <ul> <li>Weekly homework, usually given out Thursdays and to be handed in the following Thursday.</li> <li>Term project, graduate students only, due Session #21 (project proposal due Session #6).</li> <li>Two 1Â½ hour exams in Sessions #14 and #22.</li> </ul> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Use of Finite Element Computer Program</h2> <p>We will use <a href=\"http://www.adina.com/index.shtml\">ADINA</a> for all finite element program related homework and for the projects. Two special lectures, Sessions #8 and 9, will be given on the use of and modeling with ADINA for the analysis of solids and structures, fluid flows, i.e. CFD, and fluid flows with structural interactions, i.e. FSI. These lectures will prepare you to complete your homework assignments using ADINA and your project. Please see <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_finite_element_software_packages\">this page</a> for a list of alternative finite element analysis programs.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Reading Assignments</h2> <p>The reading assignments will be given in each lecture and will refer to the textbook <em>Finite Element Procedures</em>. A list of readings by session is also available on the <a href=\"/courses/mechanical-engineering/2-092-finite-element-analysis-of-solids-and-fluids-i-fall-2009/readings\">Calendar</a> page.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Computer Assignments</h2> <p>You will not be required to develop a computer program. However, some homework will require that you use the graphical user interface of the finite element program system ADINA, which can be run on your laptop.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Term Project</h2> <p>Every graduate student taking 2.093 is required to complete a term project; undergraduates taking 2.092 are not required to complete a project. Hence, the only difference between taking 2.093 (graduate students) and 2.092 (undergraduate students) is this requirement regarding the project. Further details about the project are given on the <a href=\"/courses/mechanical-engineering/2-092-finite-element-analysis-of-solids-and-fluids-i-fall-2009/projects\">Projects</a> page.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Additional Resources</h2> <p>Prof. Bathe has recorded two video courses on the topics of <a href=\"/resources/res-2-002-finite-element-procedures-for-solids-and-structures-spring-2010/linear\">Linear Analysis</a> and <a href=\"/resources/res-2-002-finite-element-procedures-for-solids-and-structures-spring-2010/nonlinear\">Nonlinear Analysis</a>, now available from MIT OpenCourseWare. While these lectures do not correspond directly to the sequence of topics in 2.092/2.093, they can serve as a useful complement to the materials presented here.</p><p>You may also be interested in the course <a href=\"/courses/mechanical-engineering/2-094-finite-element-analysis-of-solids-and-fluids-ii-spring-2011\"><em>2.094 Finite Element Analysis of Solids and Fluids II</em></a>.</p> <div class=\"help slide-bottom\"> <div class=\"help-message\"> <a class=\"help-engage\" href=\"javascript: trackEvents('Bottom Get Started','bottom get started Click','Help Overlay');\">Need help getting started?</a> <a href=\"javascript:disableHelpPopup(); trackEvents('Bottom Don\\'t Show','bottom don\\'t show Click','Help Overlay');\" class=\"help-dismiss\">Don't show me this again</a> </div> </div> <div class=\"help popup-center\"> <div class=\"help-message\"> <p class=\"help-dismiss\"><a href=\"javascript:disableHelpPopup(); trackEvents('Popup Don\\'t Show','popup don\\'t show Click','Help Overlay');\">Don't show me this again</a></p> <h2>Welcome!</h2> <p>This is one of over 2,200 courses on OCW.

The prerequisites for this course are undergraduate courses in thermodynamics and fluid mechanics, specifically Thermal-Fluids Engineering I (2.005) and Thermal Fluids Engineering II (2.006) or their equivalents. Topics to be covered include: unsteady heat conduction in one or more dimensions, steady conduction in multidimensional configurations, numerical simulation of conduction; forced convection in laminar and turbulent flows; natural convection in internal and external configurations; heat transfer during condensation and boiling; mass transfer at low rates, evaporation; thermal radiation, black bodies, grey radiation networks, spectral and solar radiation. Problems and examples will emphasize modelling of complex systems drawn from manufacturing, electronics, consumer products, and energy systems.</p> <p>The goals of this class are that students will:</p> <ol> <li>develop a strong physical and conceptual understanding of heat and mass transfer processes; and</li> <li>learn about their application to energy systems and other technologies.</li> </ol> <p>We plan to teach interactively, rather than by a strict lecture format. The class will include coverage of fundamentals (such as thermal radiation, convection, multidimensional conduction, and mass transfer) as well as thermally driven problems of current importance (such as solar energy, evaporation, and desalination).</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Classes</h2> <p>Lecturer: Prof. Bora Mikic<br /> Lectures: 2 sessions / week, 1.5 hours / session<br /> Textbook: Lienhard and Lienhard. <em><a href=\"http://web.mit.edu/lienhard/www/ahtt.html\">A Heat Transfer Textbook</a></em>. 3rd ed., 2008.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Exams and Grading</h2> <p>The grade will be based on:</p> <div class=\"maintabletemplate\"><table summary=\"See table caption for summary.\" class=\"tablewidth50\"> <caption class=\"invisible\">Grading criteria.</caption> <thead align=\"left\"> <tr> <th scope=\"col\">ACTIVITIES</th> <th scope=\"col\">PERCENTAGES</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody align=\"left\"> <tr class=\"row\"> <td>Two midterm quizzes</td> <td>40%</td> </tr> <tr class=\"alt-row\"> <td>Homework and class participation</td> <td>20%</td> </tr> <tr class=\"row\"> <td>Final exam</td> <td>40%</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> </div> <p> </p><p>The exams will be open book unless otherwise announced.

Reports turned in later than the grace time allows will be penalized at the discretion of the instructor.</li> </ul> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Written Reports</h2> <p>It is anticipated that all written reports in a group will have data, calculations and figures which are similar, <strong>but will have separately written texts</strong>. If for any reason some figures, tables, appendices or other material are copied and shared among the group, such materials should be initialed by the person who prepared the original. We want each of you to have the experience that accompanies writing a report but do not expect you to have different experimental results when you've run the same experiment. In general, each report should have enough detail so that the reader can reproduce your results. (See <a href=\"/courses/mechanical-engineering/2-672-project-laboratory-spring-2009/reports\">Section 3</a>: Guide to 2.672 Report Writing.) In the last week of the first experiment, one hour will be spent in a brief workshop on report writing.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Oral Reports</h2> <p>The results from your final experiment will be presented in an oral presentation by your group collectively. Oral presentations are an important part of communicating your results, so it should be a valuable experience. (See <a href=\"/courses/mechanical-engineering/2-672-project-laboratory-spring-2009/reports\">Section 4</a>: Guide to 2.672 Oral Presentations.)</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Grading Policy</h2> <p>There will be 3 experiments. An independently written report by each student is required for the first two; an oral presentation by the group as a whole is required for the third experiment.</p> <p>A letter grade (with pluses and minuses) will be given to each report. The final grade, however, is computed by assigning a number to each letter grade, and the following weighting is used.</p> <div class=\"maintabletemplate\"><table class=\"tablewidth50\" summary=\"See table caption for summary.\"> <caption class=\"invisible\">Grading criteria.</caption> <thead align=\"left\"> <tr> <th scope=\"col\">ACTIVITIES</th> <th scope=\"col\">PERCENTAGES</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody align=\"left\"> <tr class=\"row\"> <td>1st report (written)</td> <td>25%</td> </tr> <tr class=\"alt-row\"> <td>2nd report (written)</td> <td>25%</td> </tr> <tr class=\"row\"> <td>3rd report (oral)</td> <td>25%</td> </tr> <tr class=\"alt-row\"> <td>Lab performance (participation, knowledge of the subject etc.)</td> <td>25%</td> </tr> </tbody> </table></div> <p> </p><p>To encourage using the laboratory as learning environment, substantial weighting is assigned to the lab performance which is <strong>subjectively</strong> graded. <strong>It should be noted that much of this grade is based on the communication between you and your instructor in class</strong>. You should use the interaction to demonstrate your knowledge of the subject matter.</p> <p><strong>Late reports will be down graded.</strong> The downgrading is progressive as a function of the days past due. The grade discount is at the discretion of the instructor who will be grading the reports.</p> <p>For the first two written reports, the grading will be based half on technical content and half on how well do you communicate in writing.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Calendar</h2> <p>The calendar table illustrates the number of sessions devoted to each lab, and the due dates. See the <a href=\"/courses/mechanical-engineering/2-672-project-laboratory-spring-2009/labs\">labs</a> section for detailed information about each lab. Each lab group completes three out of seven possible experiments in a semester. The experiments involve different branches of Mechanical Engineering knowledge, so we try to assign the students for maximum exposure to heat transfer, dynamics, thermo, fluid mechanics, etc.</p> <div class=\"maintabletemplate\"><table class=\"tablewidth75\" summary=\"See table caption for summary.\"> <caption class=\"invisible\">Course calendar.</caption> <thead align=\"left\"> <tr> <th scope=\"col\">SES #</th> <th scope=\"col\">LABS</th> <th scope=\"col\">KEY DATES</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody align=\"left\"> <tr class=\"row\"> <td>1-4</td> <td>Lab 1</td> <td> </td> </tr> <tr class=\"alt-row\"> <td>5-8</td> <td>Lab 2</td> <td>Lab 1 due in Ses #5</td> </tr> <tr class=\"row\"> <td>9-11</td> <td>Lab 3</td> <td>Lab 2 due in Ses #9</td> </tr> <tr class=\"alt-row\"> <td>12</td> <td> </td> <td>Oral presentation of Lab 3 during class</td> </tr> </tbody> </table></div> <div class=\"help slide-bottom\"> <div class=\"help-message\"> <a class=\"help-engage\" href=\"javascript: trackEvents('Bottom Get Started','bottom get started Click','Help Overlay');\">Need help getting started?</a> <a href=\"javascript:disableHelpPopup(); trackEvents('Bottom Don\\'t Show','bottom don\\'t show Click','Help Overlay');\" class=\"help-dismiss\">Don't show me this again</a> </div> </div> <div class=\"help popup-center\"> <div class=\"help-message\"> <p class=\"help-dismiss\"><a href=\"javascript:disableHelpPopup(); trackEvents('Popup Don\\'t Show','popup don\\'t show Click','Help Overlay');\">Don't show me this again</a></p> <h2>Welcome!</h2> <p>This is one of over 2,200 courses on OCW.

Modeling and analysis of these elements is based upon extensive application of physics, mathematics and core mechanical engineering principles (solid mechanics, fluid mechanics, manufacturing, estimation, computer simulation, etc.). These principles are reinforced via (1) hands-on laboratory experiences wherein students conduct experiments and disassemble machines and (2) a substantial design project wherein students model, design, fabricate and characterize a mechanical system that is relevant to a real world application. Students master the materials via problems sets that are directly related to, and coordinated with, the deliverables of their project. Student assessment is based upon mastery of the course materials and the student's ability to synthesize, model and fabricate a mechanical device subject to engineering constraints (e.g. cost and time/schedule).</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Teaching Philosophy</h2> <p>&quot;The man who sets out to carry a cat by its tail learns something that will always be useful and which never will grow dim or doubtful.&quot; â Mark Twain</p> <p>Many students misunderstand the purpose of the mathematics and engineering science/modeling content that they are exposed to early in their undergraduate programs. This leads to a misperception that models and associated equations embody all of the engineering ability that is required to employ the principles they are taught. In mechanical design, good models are critical, but they are not sufficient. If you are to use mechanical design principles in your engineering practice/research, your thoughts, decisions and actions must be based upon an understanding of the following:</p> <ol> <li>Engineering/science models and their associated equations are idealizations of mechanical systems. The only thing that &quot;perfectly&quot; models all characteristics of a mechanical system is a physical embodiment of that system. This is most evident in machines where high performance and/or high risk are involved. You need to understand the limits/power of modeling and simulation in the context of mechanical design. The process of &quot;synthesizing-modeling-fabricating-testing&quot; a prototype helps to provide this insight. This is important because the construction of sensitive/high-performance systems is cost and time intensive.</li> <li>Mastery of: <ul type=\"a\"> <li>Concepts, principles, design processes, and best practices is necessary, but not sufficient, to practice mechanical design;</li> <li>Mathematics, physics and engineering modeling is necessary, but not sufficient, to practice mechanical design;</li> <li>Practical skills and familiarity with best practices is necessary, but not sufficient, to practice mechanical design.</li> </ul></li> </ol> <p>A judicious use of (a), (b), and (c) is necessary to understand and apply the principles of mechanical design. Toward this end, 2.72 will focus on:</p> <p>(i) understanding the role of concepts, principles, design process, best practices, mathematics, physics, and engineering modeling within mechanical design;</p> <p>(ii) rigorous application of concepts, principles, design process, best practices, mathematics, physics, and engineering modeling to realize a complex and high quality mechanical design.</p> <p>You will learn &quot;by doing&quot; and learn by gaining insight/perspective via interaction with the staff. This year in 2.72, teams of about 5-6 students will model, design, build and characterize the performance of a desktop lathe. Each team will design a 'group' lathe and must build at least one lathe. Each student may elect to build their own lathe through the course of the term. The construction of a device that meets functional requirements is a critical element of receiving a good grade in 2.72.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Textbook</h2> <h3 class=\"subsubhead\">Required</h3> <p><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0072921935/ref=nosim/mitopencourse-20\"><img alt=\"Buy at Amazon\" src=\"/images/a_logo_17.gif\" align=\"absMiddle\" border=\"0\" /></a> Shigley, Joseph, Charles Mischke, and Richard Budynas. <em>Mechanical Engineering Design</em>.

The class is about boat design technology, rather than simply boat design.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Grade Requirement</h2> <p>100% Class Participation</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Monday</h2> <ul dir=\"ltr\"> <li> 9:30-11:00: Morning Introduction and Shop Safety Rules </li> <li> 11:00-11:30: Primer on Course <ul> <li> Define Goals of Class <ul> <li> To give Students Experience in an Early Boat Design Technology, from Carving a Half-model by Eye, and then Translating that Shape into a Lines Plan which can be Analyzed, and then Developed into Building Plan </li> <li> To give Students Experience in Understanding how Early Design Techniques Worked to Refine design by Intuition and &quot;Boat Sense&quot; <ul> <li> Half Model a Readily Recognized and Interpretable Representation of the Performance of the Boat <ul> <li> Beyond Simple Esthetic. </li> <li> A Trained Eye, Experience Sailor/Designer/Builder Could Look at Form and Consider it in a Dynamic State, Using Mind as Computational Tool to Understand How Features of the form Assimilate </li> </ul> </li> <li> Process of Developing Lines More Opportunity to Refine the Shape </li> <li> Process of Lofting Yet Another Opportunity to Refine Form </li> <li> Essential that the Modeller Always Remain Skeptical and Critical of the Shape Their Creating </li> </ul> </li> <li> To Give Students an Awareness of How Design Methods Can Limit and Enable Development <ul> <li> Development of Half Model Designing Techniques, Replacing Whole Molding and Rule of Thumb Design, Opened up Hull Design Development Once Adopted </li> <li> System of Lifting Lines, Creating Lines Plan, and Lofting Allowed for Scientific Analysis of Hull, as well as Allowing Designer to Exert Great Influence on the Final Product </li> <li> But the System has Many Shortcomings: Time-consuming, Bad for Asymmetic Hulls, etc. </li> <li> What are Advantages and Shortcomings of CAD? </li> </ul> </li> </ul> </li> <li> Define Process of Class: Design your own Boat by Carving Half-model, Create Lines, Analyze Lines <ul> <li> Goal is to Use the Half-model Method to Explore an Idea of a Design </li> <li> Show How the Half-model Design Process is Iterative, and How Ideas are Refined Each Step of Process - How Thoughtfulness and Awareness of Process at Every Step Influences Outcome </li> <li> Grade Based on How Well the Students Use the Method to Challenge their Own Assumptions and Develop their Ideas <ul> <li> Requirements are Attendance and Participation.

The various topics covered are: Transport theorem and conservation principles, Navier-Stokes' equation, dimensional analysis, ideal and potential flows, vorticity and Kelvin's theorem, hydrodynamic forces in potential flow, D'Alembert's paradox, added-mass, slender-body theory, viscous-fluid flow, laminar and turbulent boundary layers, model testing, scaling laws, application of potential theory to surface waves, energy transport, wave/body forces, linearized theory of lifting surfaces, and experimental project in the towing tank or propeller tunnel.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Course Prerequisites</h2> <p>This course is traditionally taken by advanced undergraduate and first year graduate students in the Ocean Engineering Department. The typical capabilities of the students in the course is a very broad range due to its nature. However, a student should be very comfortable with calculus - in particular, vectors, integrals and derivatives. Complex math is not required however, some may be used during lecture.

Water is a particular problem for the developing world, but scarcity also impacts industrial societies. Water purification and desalination technology can be used to convert brackish ground water or seawater into drinking water. The challenge is to do so sustainably, with minimum cost and energy consumption, and with appropriately accessible technologies.</p> <p>This subject will survey the state-of-the-art in water purification by desalination and filtration. Fundamental thermodynamic and transport processes which govern the creation of fresh water from seawater and brackish ground water will be developed. The technologies of existing desalination systems will be discussed, and factors which limit the performance or the affordability of these systems will be highlighted. Energy efficiency will be a focus. Nanofiltration and emerging technologies for desalination will be considered. A student project in desalination will involve designing a well-water purification system for a village in Haiti.</p> <p>This course is open to graduate students and to upper-level undergraduates.

The inherent incompatibility between engineering processes at different size scales leads to machines whose interactions with larger/smaller machines may be limited or impractical. This is troublesome as mechanical systems are often required to perform functions which are best achieved via combinations of different-scale machines. This course has been developed to teach students how to engineer multi-scale mechanical systems to ensure compatibility of macro, micro and nano-scale machines/components. This is a key to enabling broad utility of emerging nano and micro-scale machines in the &quot;macro-scale world.&quot; Examples of MuSS include precision instruments, Nanomanipulators, fiber optics, Nanorobotics, MEMS, X-Ray telescopes and carbon nano-tube assemblies.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Term Project</h2> <p>Materials are studied and mastered via a project in which students design and fabricate a Scanning Tunneling Microscope (STM). A series of problem sets at the beginning of the term will lead students through key design decisions and modeling steps.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Tools</h2> <p>Students will receive a Tablet PC which contains the modeling, design and fabrication software required to complete the course project.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Paper Critique and Presentation</h2> <p>Students will read, critique and present findings on a paper which addresses MuSS research or covers important advances/implications for MuSS.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Grading</h2> <div class=\"maintabletemplate\"> <table class=\"tablewidth50\" summary=\"See table caption for summary.\"> <caption class=\"invisible\">Title for Table Goes Here</caption> <thead align=\"left\"> <tr class=\"tableheader\"> <th id=\"col1\" scope=\"col\" abbr=\"Week Number\">ACTIVITIES</th> <th id=\"col2\" scope=\"col\">PERCENTAGES</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody align=\"left\"> <tr class=\"row\"> <td headers=\"col1\">Assignments</td> <td headers=\"col2\">35%</td> </tr> <tr class=\"alt-row\"> <td headers=\"col1\">Project</td> <td headers=\"col2\">35%</td> </tr> <tr class=\"row\"> <td headers=\"col1\">Participation</td> <td headers=\"col2\">10%</td> </tr> <tr class=\"alt-row\"> <td headers=\"col1\">Paper Critique </td> <td headers=\"col2\">20%</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> </div> <div class=\"help slide-bottom\"> <div class=\"help-message\"> <a class=\"help-engage\" href=\"javascript: trackEvents('Bottom Get Started','bottom get started Click','Help Overlay');\">Need help getting started?</a> <a href=\"javascript:disableHelpPopup(); trackEvents('Bottom Don\\'t Show','bottom don\\'t show Click','Help Overlay');\" class=\"help-dismiss\">Don't show me this again</a> </div> </div> <div class=\"help popup-center\"> <div class=\"help-message\"> <p class=\"help-dismiss\"><a href=\"javascript:disableHelpPopup(); trackEvents('Popup Don\\'t Show','popup don\\'t show Click','Help Overlay');\">Don't show me this again</a></p> <h2>Welcome!</h2> <p>This is one of over 2,200 courses on OCW.

It is paced faster than 8.01L, it is less rigorous that 8.012, and it does not have the emphasis on take-home experiments that characterizes 8.01X.</p> <p>Our goal is to convey the excitement of the physicist's quest to understand nature at its deepest level, and at the same time to provide the knowledge and tools that you will need to continue your studies in science or engineering. We hope you will enjoy the course.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Lectures</h2> <p>Lectures will be given by Prof. Stanley Kowalski thrice a week, for 1 hour each. We expect you to attend the lectures. The lectures will explain the concepts that you are expected to understand, and in addition there will be live demonstrations that are important to your understanding of the material.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Recitation Classes</h2> <p>You will be assigned to a recitation class that meets twice a week, for 50 minutes each meeting. These classes will give you an opportunity to ask questions about the material, and to practice the art of problem solving. There will be five 25-minute quizzes given during recitation. If you need to change your recitation class, ask at the Physics Education Office.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Tutoring and Instructors' Office Hours</h2> <p>Graduate student tutors will be available throughout the term, and you are strongly encouraged to seek their help. Tutoring sessions last 25 minutes. Initially they will be on a drop-in basis, but we may switch to a sign-up system if there is a problem with overcrowded sessions.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Textbook</h2> <p><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0321500628/ref=nosim/mitopencourse-20\"><img alt=\"Buy at Amazon\" src=\"/images/a_logo_17.gif\" style=\"vertical-align: middle;\" border=\"0\" /></a> Young, Hugh, Lewis Ford and Roger Freedman. <em>University Physics</em>. Reading, MA: Addison-Wesley, 2003. ISBN: 0321500628.</p> <p>The textbook is a required purchase. When the material in the Study Guide is too concise for your taste, you can turn to the textbook, which provides more detailed derivations and explanations of the results and formulas. It also has more worked examples and problems, problem-solving hints, etc. Homework problems will be assigned from the textbook.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Study Guide</h2> <p>Busza, Wit, Susan Cartwright, and Alan H. Guth. <em>Essentials of Introductory Classical Mechanics.</em> 6th ed.</p> <p>The Study Guide is not a required purchase, but is recommended. It was written especially for this course and will be your main resource for the course's material. It defines the content of the course, provides a concise discussion of the relevant principles of physics, and includes a large collection of physics problems, some with full solutions and some without. If by the end of the term you understand and know how to use the material in the Study Guide, you will deserve an A for the course. Since the Study Guide is still under development, it may contain some errors. If you discover any errors, we would very much appreciate your sending an e-mail message about them. No error is too small to be worth correcting.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Problem Sets</h2> <p>Problem sets will be assigned about once a week; the exact schedule of hand-out dates and due dates is included on the Course Calendar, attached to this handout. Normally, written homework will be posted on the web on Wednesdays. It will be due the following week on Thursdays by 4 pm. There are exceptions. Check the web. Normally, Mastering Physics assignments will be posted on the web on Tuesdays. They will be due the following week on Tuesdays by 10 pm. Check the course calendar for exceptions. The two lowest homework scores will be excluded from the homework grade.</p> <p>We believe that working out the problems on the homework is absolutely essential to learning the material of this course. Trying to learn physics without doing problems is like trying to learn how to ride a bicycle by reading a book. We strongly encourage students to get together in groups to discuss the homework, but of course the mere copying of solutions written by your friends will not help you learn physics. Solutions to each problem set will be made available immediately after they are due.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Mastering Physics</h2> <p>Registered students will be given access to <a href=\"http://www.masteringphysics.com/\">Mastering Physics</a>, an on-line tutorial and homework system. We will be using the access kit that comes with Young and Freedman's eleventh edition. <strong>Note: OCW Users will not be able to access this material.</strong></p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Examinations</h2> <h3 class=\"subsubhead\">Recitation Quizzes</h3> <p>On five selected weeks, 25-minute quizzes will be given in the Wednesday and Thursday recitation sections. The dates of the recitation quizzes are shown on the course calendar.</p> <h3 class=\"subsubhead\">50-minute Exams</h3> <p>Three lecture periods during the term -- session #17, session #35, and session #53 -- will be used for 50-minute exams. Each exam will focus on all the material since the previous exam, and will include at least one problem that is at most a slight modification of a previously assigned homework problem. Students will be assigned to exam rooms according to their family names.</p> <h3 class=\"subsubhead\">Target Scores</h3> <p>The material in this course is tightly interconnected, so it is very difficult to understand the contents of Chapter N if you are not comfortable with the ideas in Chapters 1 . . . N -1. For that reason, we want to do everything that we can to encourage you to stay on top of the subject, avoiding any gaps in your understanding. As part of this encouragement, after each exam Prof. Kowalski will announce a target score -- a level that is comfortably above the passing line, which we would like all students to attain. Students who fall below the target score will have the opportunity to improve their grades (and their understanding) by taking a Make-Up Exam.</p> <h3 class=\"subsubhead\">Make-Up Exams</h3> <p>The Make-up Exams will be given on Tuesday evenings at 7:30 p.m., at least one week after the original 50-minute Exam. Make-up Exam #1 will be held during session #23; #2 will be held during session #42 at 7:30 pm; #3 will be held session #58 at 7:30 pm. The dates for the 50-minute Exams and the Make-up Exams are shown on the course calendar.

Electromagnetic forces quite literally dominate our everyday experience. The reason you do not fall through the floor to the center of the earth as you are reading this is because you are floating on (and held together by) electrostatic force fields. However, we are unaware of this in a visceral way, in large part because electromagnetic forces are so enormously strong, 10^40 times stronger than gravity.</p> <p>Because of the strength of electromagnetic forces, any small imbalance in net electric charge gives rise to enormous forces that act to try to erase that imbalance. Thus in our everyday experience, matter is by and large electrically neutral, and our direct experience with electromagnetic phenomena is disguised by many subtleties associated with that neutrality. This is very unlike our direct experience with gravitational forces, which is straightforward and unambiguous.</p> <p>The objectives of this course are to tease out the laws of electromagnetism from our everyday experience by specific examples of how electromagnetic phenomena manifest themselves. We want to be able:</p> <ol> <li>To describe, in words, the ways in which various concepts in electromagnetism come into play in particular situations;</li> <li>To represent these electromagnetic phenomena and fields mathematically in those situations;</li> <li>And to predict outcomes in other similar situations.</li> </ol> <p>The overall goal is to use the scientific method to come to understand the enormous variety of electromagnetic phenomena in terms of a few relatively simple laws.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Prerequisites</h2> <p>Physics I (8.01 or 8.012 or 8.01L or 8.01X or 8.01T)</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Format</h2> <p>This course is taught in the TEAL/Studio Physics format. This course format differs substantially from the lecture/recitation format. In this format, classes are held three times a week, twice in a two-hour block, and once in a one-hour block. Students sit at tables of nine in a specially designed classroom, with three groups of three students at each table. Mini-lectures are interspersed with desktop experiments and group problem solving and discussion. The one-hour session on the third session of the week is reserved entirely for problem solving.</p> <p>The course design is based on the following premises:</p> <ol> <li>Interaction between teacher and student is an important factor in promoting learning;</li> <li>Interaction among students is another;</li> <li>Active learning is better than passive learning;</li> <li>Hands-on experience with the phenomena under study is crucial.</li> </ol> <p>Watch a video about <a href=\"http://link.brightcove.com/services/player/bcpid1243570743?bclid=1815835555&amp;bctid=1890047992\">Technology Enhanced Active Learning (TEAL)</a>.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Collaborative Work</h2> <p>Scientists and engineers work in groups as well as alone. Social interactions are critical to their success. Most good ideas grow out of discussions with colleagues. This subject encourages collaborative teamwork. As you study together, help your partners, ask each other questions, and critique your group homework and lab write-ups. Teach each other! You can learn a great deal by teaching others.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Course Notes, Course Reader, Experiment Write-Ups, and Optional Textbook</h2> <p>The course content is contained in the 8.02 Course <a zref=\"\">lecture notes</a>. Students also need the &quot;8.02 Course Reader.&quot; This reader contains a number of different materials that you will need for the course, including experiment write-ups. You should bring this reader to class with you consistently, as it contains a lot of material that will be used in class and handed in. (Note for OCW users: The experimental write-ups and other materials included in the Course Reader are included in this OCW Web site.)</p> <p>In addition, we use many visualizations in the course.</p> <p>If you feel you need to consult a textbook for additional insight or for a different perspective, just about any of the standard introductory textbooks on electromagnetism will do. For your convenience, we reference relevant chapters of the following texts in the summaries:</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0534408427/ref=nosim/mitopencourse-20\"><img border=\"0\" alt=\"Buy at Amazon\" align=\"absMiddle\" src=\"/images/a_logo_17.gif\" /></a> Serway, Raymond A., and John W.

The idea of purchasing any supplemental text is to get a different perspective on things that are written in a style accessible to you, so shop around a little before making your decision. Any edition of any of these texts will do. It should be straightforward for you to figure out which sections in your text are relevant.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Honesty on Course Work</h2> <p>You are welcome to and encouraged to work on the homework problems with fellow students. However, the work you submit should be your own and reflect your own understanding of the subject. For in-class work, you must be present and personally write your name on any material which is turned in in that class.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Readings</h2> <p>You are responsible for reading the Course Notes and working assigned problems. You will sometimes be assigned homework problems on material that has not yet been covered in class. You should start homework early and get help if needed before the due date.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Before Class Reading</h2> <p>There is a short reading assignment (Summary) which covers the material in the up-coming class. We urge you to read this summary before coming to class.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Written Homework</h2> <p>There will be one homework handed in on paper each week. To receive full credit for your hardcopy homework handed in, you must prepare and submit lucid and clearly reasoned written solutions. These problems will be graded and returned. (Note: Written homework assignments are not available to OCW users.)</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">In-class Group and Personal Assignments</h2> <p>In almost all classes, individuals and groups (see below) will submit answers to questions about desktop experiments done in class, material covered in the lecture in that class, and so on. You must be present in class to receive credit for assignments submitted either by you or by your group.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Group Work</h2> <p>You will be assigned to a group of three for collaborative work. Your group assignment will be announced near the beginning of the term. If you are not satisfied with the way your group is working, first try to discuss it with your group members. If you cannot arrive at a satisfactory solution, then discuss the problems with your instructor.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Laboratory</h2> <p>You will be offered hands-on, inquiry-based activities during the class period. These labs allow you to discover various aspects of a physics concept. Labs will vary in length and complexity and will be done in groups.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Tests</h2> <p>Three 1Â½ hour tests will be given. There will be a final in the course. The final will be a comprehensive exam and will cover all of the subject material.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Grades</h2> <p>Grades are not curved in this subject. If everyone in the class does well, everyone can get an A. Once the final course grade has been computed at the end of the term, grades will be assigned adhering strictly to the break-points below. Grades (+/-) will be assigned based on your overall, weighted class average using the weighting scheme presented below.</p> <div class=\"maintabletemplate\"> <table class=\"tablewidth50\" summary=\"See table caption for summary.\"> <caption class=\"invisible\">Weighting scheme.</caption> <thead align=\"left\"> <tr> <th scope=\"col\">TASKS</th> <th scope=\"col\">WEIGHTS</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody align=\"left\"> <tr class=\"row\"> <td>Tests + Final</td> <td>45% + 25%</td> </tr> <tr class=\"alt-row\"> <td>Problem sets</td> <td>10%</td> </tr> <tr class=\"row\"> <td>Mastering physics</td> <td>4%</td> </tr> <tr class=\"alt-row\"> <td>Friday problem solving</td> <td>6%</td> </tr> <tr class=\"row\"> <td>Experiments</td> <td>6%</td> </tr> <tr class=\"alt-row\"> <td>Concept questions</td> <td>4%</td> </tr> <tr class=\"row\"> <td> </td> <td>100%</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> </div> <div class=\"maintabletemplate\"> <table class=\"tablewidth50\" summary=\"See table caption for summary.\"> <caption class=\"invisible\">Breakpoints table.</caption> <thead align=\"left\"> <tr> <th colspan=\"4\" scope=\"col\">BREAKPOINTS</th><th scope=\"col\" style=\"display: none;\" io-table-normalizer=\"\">BREAKPOINTS</th><th scope=\"col\" style=\"display: none;\" io-table-normalizer=\"\">BREAKPOINTS</th><th scope=\"col\" style=\"display: none;\" io-table-normalizer=\"\">BREAKPOINTS</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody align=\"left\"> <tr class=\"row\"> <td> </td> <td>+</td> <td> </td> <td>-</td> </tr> <tr class=\"alt-row\"> <td>A</td> <td>&gt;= 95</td> <td>&lt; 95 and &gt;= 90</td> <td>&lt; 90 and &gt;= 85</td> </tr> <tr class=\"row\"> <td>B</td> <td>&lt; 85 and &gt;= 80</td> <td>&lt; 80 and &gt;= 75</td> <td>&lt; 75 and &gt;= 70</td> </tr> <tr class=\"alt-row\"> <td>C</td> <td>&lt; 70 and &gt;= 67</td> <td>&lt; 67 and &gt;= 64</td> <td>&lt; 64 and &gt;= 60</td> </tr> <tr class=\"row\"> <td>D</td> <td> </td> <td>&lt; 60 and &gt;= 55</td> <td> </td> </tr> <tr class=\"alt-row\"> <td>F</td> <td> </td> <td>&lt; 55</td> <td> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table> </div> <div class=\"help slide-bottom\"> <div class=\"help-message\"> <a class=\"help-engage\" href=\"javascript: trackEvents('Bottom Get Started','bottom get started Click','Help Overlay');\">Need help getting started?</a> <a href=\"javascript:disableHelpPopup(); trackEvents('Bottom Don\\'t Show','bottom don\\'t show Click','Help Overlay');\" class=\"help-dismiss\">Don't show me this again</a> </div> </div> <div class=\"help popup-center\"> <div class=\"help-message\"> <p class=\"help-dismiss\"><a href=\"javascript:disableHelpPopup(); trackEvents('Popup Don\\'t Show','popup don\\'t show Click','Help Overlay');\">Don't show me this again</a></p> <h2>Welcome!</h2> <p>This is one of over 2,200 courses on OCW.

Problem set 1 and 6 cover three lectures instead of two and may be longer than usual. Some problems will be from the textbooks, some will be prepared by the lecturer. The solutions need to be readable. It is important for the graders to measure your understanding of the material. You need to include all important logical steps in the derivation of the answer. Check the <strong>&quot;honesty&quot; page (</strong><a href=\"/courses/physics/8-03-physics-iii-spring-2003/syllabus/honesty.pdf\"><strong>PDF</strong></a><strong>)</strong> of how to work together with other students.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Worked Examples</h2> <p>Each homework assignment will be accompanied by a set of examples with solutions covering the same material. Most of these have been homework problems in previous years. You are expected to study and understand these examples. If there is any aspect that is not clear, raise it with your recitation instructor. When making up the exams, we will assume that you are as familiar with these examples as you are with the homework problems that you have worked on your own. In particular, they may form the basis, in whole or in part, for a question on the exam.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Take-Home Experiments</h2> <p>You will be provided with experiment kits and an <a href=\"/courses/physics/8-03-physics-iii-spring-2003/labs\">instruction manual</a> on doing several carefully designed experiments relevant to the course material at home. These kits will be available by the second week of classes. The purpose of these experiments is to give you a first hand knowledge of some of the simple physical phenomena associated with vibrations and waves. You will increase your understanding of each phenomenon by varying one or more parameters and observing the resulting changes. The key elements are that you do the experiment yourself and you see and think about the results. These experiments were not designed to teach you laboratory techniques or to train you in data analysis. None of the experiments requires an elaborate setup and in no case are you required to take and plot a set of data points.</p> <p>The experiments are meant to be short. The experiments on the Fresnel equations and on the MoirÃ© pattern simulation of interference phenomena can be done in a few minutes. A few require planning: the sealant used for the liquid prism and the scattering experiments requires 24 hours to set. Some, such as the polarization and transmission grating experiments you can carry in your pocket and try out on a variety of sources.</p> <p>To do the experiments is a requirement for the course. The current experiments will be listed on your weekly homework assignments. If there is a homework problem related to an experiment, the answer has to be turned in on the homework due date. Staple the experiment report to the homework solutions! Otherwise, you should just do the experiment. Towards the end of the term you should turn in evidence that you have done the experiments. This could be a short description of your observations, suggestions for improving the experiments, including the instructions and explanation, suggestions for further experiments using the kit, or simply a photograph of your setup. No grades will be assigned for the experiments, but not delivering the evidence will result in a course grade of incomplete.</p> <p>We hope to organize a photo contest with the take-home experiments. Take photographs of your experiments and submit them to the instructors. Your aethestically gifted and artistic 8.03 teaching staff will choose three winners for a TBD prize.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Computer Usage</h2> <p>Using computers to illustrate solutions of many equations encountered in 8.03 is highly encouraged. You can use any software, calculators etc. including symbolic math to help you visualize and understand the physics of waves and vibrations. It is also possible to voluntarily replace some of the take home experiments by MATLAB<sup>Â®</sup> projects. Talk to an instructor if you are interested in a <a href=\"http://www.mathworks.com/\" target=\"_blank\">MATLAB</a><sup>Â®</sup> or Mathematica<sup>Â®</sup> project.</p> <p>Be sure you can do all of your calculations without electronic aids as well: there will be no access to MATLAB<sup>Â®</sup> or other computer programs during written exams!</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">In-class Exams</h2> <p>There will be three written exams and a Final. The exams will be based on the material presented in lecture, reading assignments and the problem sets. There are no makeup exams, the missed exams will normally count as zero. Under special circumstances, students may be excused by the lecturer, in which case the grade for that exam will not be counted in that student's total score.</p> <div class=\"help slide-bottom\"> <div class=\"help-message\"> <a class=\"help-engage\" href=\"javascript: trackEvents('Bottom Get Started','bottom get started Click','Help Overlay');\">Need help getting started?</a> <a href=\"javascript:disableHelpPopup(); trackEvents('Bottom Don\\'t Show','bottom don\\'t show Click','Help Overlay');\" class=\"help-dismiss\">Don't show me this again</a> </div> </div> <div class=\"help popup-center\"> <div class=\"help-message\"> <p class=\"help-dismiss\"><a href=\"javascript:disableHelpPopup(); trackEvents('Popup Don\\'t Show','popup don\\'t show Click','Help Overlay');\">Don't show me this again</a></p> <h2>Welcome!</h2> <p>This is one of over 2,200 courses on OCW.

Upper Saddle River, NJ: Prentice Hall, 1989. ISBN: 9780137127955.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Prerequisites</h2> <p>You must complete Quantum Mechanics II (<a href=\"/courses/physics/8-05-quantum-physics-ii-fall-2013\">8.05</a>) with a grade of C or better before attempting 8.06.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Grading</h2> <p>Grades will be determined by a weighted average of problem sets, a Midterm that will be held in class, a Term Paper, and a Final Exam. The faculty may alter grades to reflect class participation, improvement, effort and other qualitative measures of performance.</p> <div class=\"maintabletemplate\"><table summary=\"See table caption for summary.\" class=\"tablewidth50\"> <caption class=\"invisible\">Grading table.</caption> <thead align=\"left\"> <tr> <th scope=\"col\">ACTIVITIES</th> <th scope=\"col\">PERCENTAGES</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody align=\"left\"> <tr class=\"row\"> <td>Problem Sets</td> <td>30%</td> </tr> <tr class=\"alt-row\"> <td>Midterm Exam</td> <td>15%</td> </tr> <tr class=\"row\"> <td>Term Paper</td> <td>20%</td> </tr> <tr class=\"alt-row\"> <td>Final Exam</td> <td>35%</td> </tr> </tbody> </table></div> <p> </p><h2 class=\"subhead\">Problem Sets</h2> <p>Problem sets are a very important part of 8.06. We believe that sitting down yourself and trying to reason your way through a problem not only helps you learn the material deeply, but also develops analytical tools fundamental to a successful career in science. We recognize that students also learn a great deal from talking to and working with each other. We therefore encourage each 8.06 student to make his/her own attempt on every problem and then, having done so, to discuss the problems with one another and collaborate on understanding them more fully. The solutions you submit must reflect your own work. They must not be transcriptions or reproductions of other people's work. Plagiarism is a serious offense and is easy to recognize. Don't submit work which is not your own.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Term Paper</h2> <p>Everyone in 8.06 will be expected to research, write and &quot;publish&quot; a short paper on a topic related to the content of 8.05 or 8.06. The paper can explain a physical effect or further explicate ideas or problems covered in the courses. It can be based on the student's own calculations and/or library research. The paper should be written in the style and format of a brief journal article and should aim at an audience of 8.06 students. Writing, editing, revising and &quot;publishing&quot; skills are an integral part of the project, which is described in full in the <a href=\"/courses/physics/8-06-quantum-physics-iii-spring-2005/projects\">projects</a> section.</p> <p>Because 8.06 is a CI-M (<a href=\"http://web.mit.edu/commreq/background.html\">Communication Intensive in the Major</a>) Subject, in order to pass 8.06 you must obtain a grade of C or better on your term paper. If you do not succeed in this, you will get a grade of Incomplete until you revise your term paper sufficiently to earn at least a C, and only at that time you will be assigned a final grade based on the breakdown given above.</p> <div class=\"help slide-bottom\"> <div class=\"help-message\"> <a class=\"help-engage\" href=\"javascript: trackEvents('Bottom Get Started','bottom get started Click','Help Overlay');\">Need help getting started?</a> <a href=\"javascript:disableHelpPopup(); trackEvents('Bottom Don\\'t Show','bottom don\\'t show Click','Help Overlay');\" class=\"help-dismiss\">Don't show me this again</a> </div> </div> <div class=\"help popup-center\"> <div class=\"help-message\"> <p class=\"help-dismiss\"><a href=\"javascript:disableHelpPopup(); trackEvents('Popup Don\\'t Show','popup don\\'t show Click','Help Overlay');\">Don't show me this again</a></p> <h2>Welcome!</h2> <p>This is one of over 2,200 courses on OCW.

We will probably have a lecture or two to introduce his General Theory as well, but the principal focus will be on special relativity, which we will study in quite a bit of detail. If you have hoped to understand the physics of Lorentz contraction, time dilation, the &quot;twin paradox&quot;, and E=mc<sup>2</sup>, you're in the right place.</p> <p>8.20 is a 9-unit course given in the four weeks of <a href=\"http://web.mit.edu/iap/\" target=\"_blank\">IAP</a>. A 9-unit course is roughly equivalent to 30 hours a week for four weeks, be prepared to work hard! Problem sets will come upon you quickly. So will the midterm and the final. The course will be defined by the lectures. The reading is an important part of the course, but if you want to know what you are responsible for, it's the material that is presented in lecture unless otherwise explicitly stated.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Course Prerequisites</h2> <p>8.20 is open to all MIT students who have completed or placed out of 8.01 (Physics I - Classical Mechanics) and 18.01 (Calculus I). Anyone in the MIT community who is familiar with elementary mechanics and who has a good knowledge of algebra (and a little knowledge of calculus) will find the course accessible.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Textbooks</h2> <p>The following textbooks are required or strongly recommended. Readings will be assigned in Resnick and Halliday and in French. Einstein's book is a cultural classic.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0471717258/ref=nosim/mitopencourse-20\"><img border=\"0\" align=\"absMiddle\" src=\"/images/a_logo_17.gif\" alt=\"Buy at Amazon\" /></a> Resnick, Robert. <em>Introduction to Special Relativity.</em> New York, NY: Wiley, 1968.

The course is designed for MIT sophomores, juniors, and seniors who want to understand the fundamental laws and physical processes that govern the sources, extraction, transmission, storage, degradation, and end uses of energy.</p> <p>The course is not aimed specifically at physics majors. It is designed for any MIT student, including, for example, an engineer, scientist, social scientist, or management, architecture or planning major, who wants to get a firm foundation in the physical principles that constrain the energy landscape. The course will enable students to approach energy issues in a sophisticated and scientific fashion, but without having to take advanced subjects in thermodynamics, quantum mechanics, or nuclear physics beforehand.</p> <p>You may have heard about courses on the &quot;Physics of Energy&quot; offered at other universities. The ones we know of are aimed at non-scientists without a background in calculus or calculus-based physics. Because MIT undergraduates are so well prepared in mathematics and physics, we will present material at a considerably more advanced level. This should make the course more exciting (and more challenging). Much of the reading and background material for 8.21 is being created specifically for this course, since existing introductory books and resources on energy physics do not seem to be advanced enough for MIT undergraduates.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Outline</h2> <p>Part I - Energy and its Uses</p> <ul> <li>Units and scales of energy use</li> <li>Mechanical energy and transport</li> <li>Heat energy: Conversion between heat and mechanical energy</li> <li>Electromagnetic energy: Storage, conversion, transmission and radiation</li> <li>Quantum mechanics I: Intro to the quantum, energy quantization</li> <li>Energy in chemical systems and processes, flow of CO2</li> <li>Entropy and temperature</li> <li>Heat engines</li> <li>Conversion I: Phase change energy conversion, refrigeration and heat pumps</li> <li>Internal combustion engines</li> <li>Conversion II: Steam and gas power cycles, the physics of power plants</li> </ul> <p>Part II - Sources of Energy</p> <ul> <li>Fundamental forces in the universe</li> <li>Quantum mechanics II: Quantum mechanics relevant for nuclear physics</li> <li>Nuclear I: Nuclear forces, energy scales and structure</li> <li>Nuclear II: Nuclear binding energy systematics, reactions and decays</li> <li>Nuclear III: Nuclear fusion</li> <li>Nuclear IV: Nuclear fission and fission reactor physics</li> <li>Nuclear V: Nuclear fission reactor design, safety, operation and fuel cycles</li> <li>The flow of energy in the universe</li> <li>Solar I: Solar radiation</li> <li>Solar II: Absorption and thermal utilization</li> <li>Solar III: Solar-thermal electricity</li> <li>Solar IV: Photovoltaics</li> <li>Solar V: Advanced PV, overview</li> <li>Biological energy sources and fossil fuels</li> <li>Wind I: Fluid dynamics and power in the wind, available resources</li> <li>Wind II: More about fluids, viscosity, types of fluid flow, lift</li> <li>Wind III: Wind turbine dynamics and design, wind farms</li> <li>Geothermal power and ocean thermal energy conversion</li> <li>Tidal/wave/hydro power</li> </ul> <p>Part III - Systems and Synthesis</p> <ul> <li>Nuclear radiation, fuel cycles, waste and proliferation</li> <li>Climate change I</li> <li>Climate change II</li> <li>Climate change III</li> <li>Energy storage</li> <li>Energy conservation</li> </ul> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Homework and Exams</h2> <p>Problem sets are issued weekly.

If you complete this subject you should be equipped with the technical tools and perspective to enable you to start to evaluate energy choices objectively and quantitatively both at a national policy and a personal level.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Additional Comments</h2> <ul> <li>This course will focus on the fundamental physical principles underlying energy processes, and on application of these principles to practical calculations. We will emphasize quantitative analysis and will introduce and apply many important analytical tools. It is not intended to be a survey course.</li> <li>The course will focus on the physics. Tough political, economic, social, and ethical issues will have to be resolved if the &quot;energy crisis&quot; is to be ameliorated. Although they will not be discussed directly in the course, the course will provide the scientific foundation for intelligent evaluation of those important considerations.</li> <li>If you are interested in studying any particular energy technology in great depth, you will want to take additional, more advanced subjects at MIT. Our hope is that this course will give you enough background to approach those subjects with a broad and functional perspective on the physics of energy.</li> </ul> <div class=\"help slide-bottom\"> <div class=\"help-message\"> <a class=\"help-engage\" href=\"javascript: trackEvents('Bottom Get Started','bottom get started Click','Help Overlay');\">Need help getting started?</a> <a href=\"javascript:disableHelpPopup(); trackEvents('Bottom Don\\'t Show','bottom don\\'t show Click','Help Overlay');\" class=\"help-dismiss\">Don't show me this again</a> </div> </div> <div class=\"help popup-center\"> <div class=\"help-message\"> <p class=\"help-dismiss\"><a href=\"javascript:disableHelpPopup(); trackEvents('Popup Don\\'t Show','popup don\\'t show Click','Help Overlay');\">Don't show me this again</a></p> <h2>Welcome!</h2> <p>This is one of over 2,200 courses on OCW.

First, we shall discuss topics of interest for both condensed matter and atomic physics, focussing on the effects of quantum statistics, interactions, and correlations in many-particle systems. Our second goal will be to provide a gentle introduction to the methods of quantized fields and their applications in many-body physics. We shall try to emphasize the physical and visualizable aspects of the subject.

The theme of the course will be different from the traditional approach of teaching string theory. Instead of looking at the theory from the point of view of the world-sheet observer, we will approach the problem from the point of view of an observer which lives on a brane. Instead of writing down conformal field theory on the world-sheet and studying the properties of these theories, we will look at various branes in string theory and ask how the physics on their world-volume looks like. This will give a totally different approach than the usual CFT approach on the world-sheet and will give new intuition and new insights on how we should think and understand string theory in various dimensions and supersymmetries. This approach is relatively new. It is a result of the change in thinking the world of string theory had gone through in the past 10 years. During this period researchers in the field begun to understand the importance of branes in string theory and the crucial role they play in various phenomena. The realization that branes are crucial in string theory then led to an opening of a whole new world of research that has to do with the dynamics of supersymmetric gauge theories and quantum field theories on the world-volume of branes in various dimensions and supersymmetries.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Objectives</h2> <p>By the end of this course, we should be able to take an arbitrary configuration of branes and construct a supersymmetric field theory that resembles the Standard Model. We will cover D-branes, which are supersymmetric string solitonic 1 solutions. A D<em>p</em>-brane is a membrane with <em>p</em> spatial dimensions (or <em>p+</em>1 spacetime dimensions). We will study D<em>p</em>-branes, NS-branes, M-branes, small instantons, and their world-volume theories and interactions. We'd like to build up an understanding of quantum field theory and supersymmetric gauge theory in the world-volume of the brane, so that we can eventually make a connection to phenomenology.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Text, Lecture Notes, and Readings</h2> <p>There is no required textbook for this course.

ISBN: 9780805387322.</p> <h3 class=\"subsubhead\">Other Relevant Texts</h3> <p>General relativity is a subject that is either blessed or cursed (depending on your point of view) with an abundance of textbooks. Some of the ones I recommend for further reading are:</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0716703440/ref=nosim/mitopencourse-20\"><img border=\"0\" align=\"absMiddle\" alt=\"Buy at Amazon\" src=\"/images/a_logo_17.gif\" /></a> Misner, Charles W., Kip S. Thorne, and John Archibald Wheeler. <em>Gravitation</em>. San Francisco, CA: W.H. Freeman, 1973. ISBN: 9780716703440.<br /> Universally known as MTW, a fantastic text if you already know GR thoroughly; rather intimidating if you are studying it for the first time. Still the best reference, in my opinion, for certain important topics; a few readings will be assigned from this volume.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0521277035/ref=nosim/mitopencourse-20\"><img border=\"0\" align=\"absMiddle\" alt=\"Buy at Amazon\" src=\"/images/a_logo_17.gif\" /></a> Schutz, Bernard. <em>A First Course in General Relativity</em>. New York, NY: Cambridge University Press, 1985. ISBN: 9780521277037.<br /> Gives very clear and careful introductory discussion of the mathematics that underlies general relativity.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0805386629/ref=nosim/mitopencourse-20\"><img border=\"0\" align=\"absMiddle\" alt=\"Buy at Amazon\" src=\"/images/a_logo_17.gif\" /></a> Hartle, James. <em>Gravity: An introduction to Einstein's general relativity</em>. San Francisco, CA: Addison-Wesley, 2002. ISBN: 9780805386622.<br /> A wonderful introduction to the subject, with the aim to get to important physical concepts as quickly as possible. As a consequence, Hartle jumps around a bit, deferring the introduction of some important quantities (such as curvature) to rather late in the text. This text is more elementary than I like for a graduate course, but is perfect for an undergraduate GR course.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0471925675/ref=nosim/mitopencourse-20\"><img border=\"0\" align=\"absMiddle\" alt=\"Buy at Amazon\" src=\"/images/a_logo_17.gif\" /></a> Weinberg, Steven. <em>Gravitation and Cosmology.</em> New York, NY: Wiley, 1972. ISBN: 9780471925675.<br /> There is perhaps no textbook in this subject that is held with such divergent views as this one. Many people love it because of the clarity of Weinberg's writing and presentation; quite a few hate it because of Weinberg's steadfast refusal to embrace wholeheartedly the notion of geometry as the central issue in GR. Weinberg does introduce and discuss the relevant geometric notions as appropriate, he just does not give them the starring role many people feel they deserve. Much like MTW, I find certain pieces of Weinberg's text to be fantastic; others less so. (In both cases, this is mostly due to the fact that these books were published over 30 years ago; the field and our ideas of how to teach it have advanced quite a bit since then.)</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0226870332/ref=nosim/mitopencourse-20\"><img border=\"0\" align=\"absMiddle\" alt=\"Buy at Amazon\" src=\"/images/a_logo_17.gif\" /></a> Wald, Robert. <em>General relativity</em>. Chicago, IL: University of Chicago Press, 1984. ISBN: 9780226870335.<br /> The GR Ã¼berbuch; typically the final arbiter of right and wrong in this subject. Quite mathematically sophisticated, and rather terse.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0521830915/ref=nosim/mitopencourse-20\"><img border=\"0\" align=\"absMiddle\" alt=\"Buy at Amazon\" src=\"/images/a_logo_17.gif\" /></a> Poisson, Eric. <em>A Relativist's Toolkit</em>. New York, NY: Cambridge University Press, 2004. ISBN: 9780521830911.<br /> The focus of this book is the machinery needed for advanced analysis of black holes. I am likely to use bits and pieces of Eric's analysis in 8.962.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Problem Sets</h2> <p>There will be a total of 11 problem sets.

The purpose of this subject is to find ways to deal with the vast array of information we have about Congress. The two basic questions we will be asking are (1) what does Congress do and why and (2) What are the various ways of studying congressional behavior?</p> <p>To accomplish these goals, this subject is organized around two major learning modes: lectures/discussion and paper/presentation. The lecture/discussion part will expose you to the basic social facts about Congress: what it takes to get elected, how Congress works internally, and how the relationships between Congress and the rest of the federal government are organized. The paper will focus on the 2004 congressional election, and allow you to analyze the outcomes of this important national election in light of the research on elections you will learn about.</p> <p>This subject introduces students to Congress, primarily undergraduates, but graduate students who have never studied Congress are welcome, too. It is more empirical than theoretical, although theory encroaches here and there. The second subject in this sequence, which will be offered next year, is a seminar that is more theoretical than empirical, and is aimed toward graduate students and advanced undergraduates.</p> <p>Having an introductory subject in American politics or policymaking, or receiving a 4 or 5 on the AP American Politics exam, is a prerequisite to taking 17.251.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Subject Requirements</h2> <h3 class=\"subsubhead\">Readings</h3> <p>The core reading will be my textbook I will pay you $1 for each typo you find in the book, so that the second edition (let's hope!) will be better than the first.</p> <p>In addition to the textbook, there are several assignments that will augment the lectures and the text. You will do all the readings to coincide with the schedule at the end of the syllabus.</p> <p>The following books are available for purchase:</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0393976262/ref=nosim/mitopencourse-20\"><img border=\"0\" align=\"absMiddle\" src=\"/images/a_logo_17.gif\" alt=\"Buy at Amazon\" /></a> Stewart, Charles, III. <em>Analyzing Congress.</em> New York, NY: W.W.

Second, they will put the readings in their larger contexts and, I hope, set the stage for discussions of the readings. I especially encourage you to ask questions during the lectures, either for clarification or to explore topics of interest to you.</p> <h3 class=\"subsubhead\">Examinations</h3> <p>There will be a midterm and a one-hour final. The final will be held during the final examination period.</p> <h3 class=\"subsubhead\">Paper</h3> <p>The upcoming congressional election will be important and interesting, from a number of perspectives. You will be responsible for taking a broad topic that is pertinent to the study of Congress and writing a 12-15 page paper about it in the context of the 2004 congressional election. Topics you might write about include new patterns of campaign finance, membership turnover, congressional redistricting, the performance of statistical models predicting the 2004 outcome, and the possible special Senate election in Massachusetts. More on this assignment once the class gets going.</p> <h3 class=\"subsubhead\">Problem Set</h3> <p>There are two problem sets in the term. You will be penalized for turning them in late.</p> <h3 class=\"subsubhead\">Class Attendance</h3> <p>You must come to class. If you can't come to class because you are sick or out of town, e-mail or call me ahead of time and let me know. Students who do not come to class, or who come and appear to be disengaged with the material (as evidenced by the fact that they never ask questions or contribute to discussions) will receive a lower grade.</p> <h3 class=\"subsubhead\">Congressional Roundtable</h3> <p>Each Wednesday we will start the class with a brief (15 minutes?) informal discussion about that week's developments in Congress. Everyone will be required to come into class with a newspaper/magazine/Web page clipping to talk about, by Tuesday at 5:00 p.m. You will also need to e-mail me by, class time, the citation to the article.

During the first half of the semester we will meet weekly in seminar and pore through (most of the) important books that have set the agenda in contemporary congressional scholarship. During the second half, we will meet to discuss your own research in progress and the current literatures it addresses. When the semester is finished, you should be well enough acquainted with the current congressional literature that you could do well on a general exam question about Congress. You will also have a paper that with a little work (perhaps) could be submitted to a journal.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Requirements</h2> <ol> <li>Weekly attendance and participation.</li> <li>Weekly literature memos. By Monday before class, you will have emailed to other class participants a series of questions you'd like to see addressed in the discussion.</li> <li>Research paper (25-30 pages). Due at the end of the semester.</li> </ol> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Special Words About the Last Half of the Class</h2> <p>I have specified a fixed reading list through the first week of November. After that, the direction of the class will be guided by seminar participants. The exact details depend on how many participants we have and their interests. The idea is that during November, each participant will be responsible for a week. The week's leader will generate a reading list of contemporary scholarship that his or her seminar paper responds to. The reading should amount to approximately 100 pages of material. At the designated seminar meeting, the leader will first lead us in a discussion of his/her chosen readings. Once that is finished, the leader will discuss his or her own research plans. Finally, once these sessions are through, we will hear again from participants as the research progresses.</p> <div class=\"help slide-bottom\"> <div class=\"help-message\"> <a class=\"help-engage\" href=\"javascript: trackEvents('Bottom Get Started','bottom get started Click','Help Overlay');\">Need help getting started?</a> <a href=\"javascript:disableHelpPopup(); trackEvents('Bottom Don\\'t Show','bottom don\\'t show Click','Help Overlay');\" class=\"help-dismiss\">Don't show me this again</a> </div> </div> <div class=\"help popup-center\"> <div class=\"help-message\"> <p class=\"help-dismiss\"><a href=\"javascript:disableHelpPopup(); trackEvents('Popup Don\\'t Show','popup don\\'t show Click','Help Overlay');\">Don't show me this again</a></p> <h2>Welcome!</h2> <p>This is one of over 2,200 courses on OCW.

This course will examine public opinion and assess its place in the American political system. The course will emphasize both how citizens' thinking about politics is shaped and the role of public opinion in political campaigns, elections, and government. While the course will focus on research on the current state of public opinion, throughout the course we will also discuss historical developments in opinion and its place in politics, including changes that arose with the development of polling and with the advent of television and other electronic media. We will also consider normative questions, including the role opinion <strong>should</strong> play in American democracy.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Requirements and Expectations</h2> <p>You are expected to attend every class session. You are further expected to come prepared to discuss the issues raised in the <a href=\"/courses/political-science/17-265-public-opinion-and-american-democracy-spring-2007/readings\">readings</a>. Please read the assigned materials <strong>before class</strong> on the date they are listed.</p> <p>To meet the purpose of the course, you will be expected to both consume and digest readings from scholarly and journalistic sources. You are also expected to be aware of current events, especially relating to American politics. I highly recommend that you subscribe to and read a national newspaper, such as the <em>Wall Street Journal</em> or the <em>New York Times</em>.</p> <p>Each week, one-half of the class will be required to write a short essay responding to the week's readings, no longer than two single-spaced pages. Students will also be required to write two papers for the class. More details about these papers can be found in <a href=\"/courses/political-science/17-265-public-opinion-and-american-democracy-spring-2007/assignments\">assignments</a> .</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Grading</h2> <p>Your grade will be determined as follows:</p> <div class=\"maintabletemplate\"> <table class=\"tablewidth50\" summary=\"See table caption for summary.\"> <caption class=\"invisible\">Grading criteria.</caption> <thead align=\"left\"> <tr> <th scope=\"col\">ACTIVITIES</th> <th scope=\"col\">PERCENTAGES</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody align=\"left\"> <tr class=\"row\"> <td> <p>Participation (regular attendance and participation in class discussion is required)</p> </td> <td>35%</td> </tr> <tr class=\"alt-row\"> <td>Weekly Papers</td> <td>25%</td> </tr> <tr class=\"row\"> <td>Short Paper</td> <td>10%</td> </tr> <tr class=\"alt-row\"> <td>Long Paper</td> <td>30%</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> </div> <p>I expect that all papers will be turned in <strong>on time</strong>: no exceptions; no excuses.

It explores the market and regulatory policy options being debated politically in the United States to solve these problems and compares possible foreign models for reform including those offered by the Canadian, British, Japanese, and German systems. The course shows how the historical development of the American health care system limits greatly policy options that can be considered and creates pressures that favor a continuing emphasis on technology and structural decentralization. The course also examines important health risks and the political and organizational factors that distort the public's understanding of these risks.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Course Requirements</h2> <p><a href=\"/courses/political-science/17-315-comparative-health-policy-fall-2004/exams\">Midterm and final examinations</a>: The midterm examination tests for background information on the U.S. system.

We open by discussing cultural and institutional reasons for American exceptionalism in social policy, using the case of health insurance. In the second part of the class, we begin studying policy inputs with a focus on the mass public: defining political participation, studying subgroup differences in participation rates, exploring the origins of political preferences, examining patterns of interest group organization, and discussing the nature of representative government and the theoretical relationship between participation and representation. In the third part of the course we turn to the policymaking process, studying how problems come onto the political agenda and how Congress, the courts, and the bureaucracy shape policy. Fourth, we study policy in practice: how policies are implemented; how their designs shape client experiences and subsequent policy outcomes; where we draw the line between public and private provision; and with a few final case studies how the working years, gender, and human capital formation (education) are treated by U.S. social policy. We conclude by speculating about the likely course of American social policy in the future.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Grading</h2> <p>Grades will be earned on the following basis:</p> <div class=\"maintabletemplate\"> <table class=\"tablewidth50\" summary=\"See table caption for summary.\"> <caption class=\"invisible\">Grading criteria.</caption> <thead align=\"left\"> <tr> <th scope=\"col\">ACTIVITIES</th> <th scope=\"col\">PERCENTAGES</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody align=\"left\"> <tr class=\"row\"> <td>Class Participation</td> <td>20%</td> </tr> <tr class=\"alt-row\"> <td>Intermediate Projects (Assignments 1-4)</td> <td>20%</td> </tr> <tr class=\"row\"> <td>Final Paper</td> <td>60%</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> </div> <br /> <p>Students are expected to complete the intermediate projects, each of which is a stage in preparing the final research paper. For the research paper, students will choose a policy area and examine the course of policymaking - what factors led to the policy outcome that was achieved? The final paper (20-25 pages, double-spaced, 12-point type) is due 2 days after Lec #25 at 5:00 pm at my office. Students will also take turns writing discussion questions and helping to lead class discussion (3-4 times during the semester, depending on enrollment). These efforts will be part of the seminar participation grade. The discussion questions should be emailed to the class by 5:00 pm the evening before your assigned day.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Calendar</h2> <br /> <div class=\"maintabletemplate\"> <table class=\"tablewidth75\" summary=\"See table caption for summary.\"> <caption class=\"invisible\">Course calendar.</caption> <thead align=\"left\"> <tr> <th scope=\"col\">LEC #</th> <th scope=\"col\">TOPICS</th> <th scope=\"col\">KEY DATES</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody align=\"left\"> <tr class=\"row\"> <td>1</td> <td>Introduction</td> <td></td> </tr> <tr class=\"alt-row\"> <td colspan=\"3\"><strong>Part I: American Exceptionalism and a Case: Why No National Health Insurance in the United States?</strong></td><td style=\"display: none;\" io-table-normalizer=\"\"><strong>Part I: American Exceptionalism and a Case: Why No National Health Insurance in the United States?</strong></td><td style=\"display: none;\" io-table-normalizer=\"\"><strong>Part I: American Exceptionalism and a Case: Why No National Health Insurance in the United States?</strong></td> </tr> <tr class=\"row\"> <td>2-3</td> <td>U.S. Health Policy</td> <td></td> </tr> <tr class=\"alt-row\"> <td colspan=\"3\"><strong>Part II: Preferences, Participation, and Representation</strong> </td><td style=\"display: none;\" io-table-normalizer=\"\"><strong>Part II: Preferences, Participation, and Representation</strong> </td><td style=\"display: none;\" io-table-normalizer=\"\"><strong>Part II: Preferences, Participation, and Representation</strong> </td> </tr> <tr class=\"row\"> <td>4</td> <td>Who Participates?</td> <td></td> </tr> <tr class=\"alt-row\"> <td>5</td> <td>Who Gets Represented?

Nowhere are such questions more salient than in the future trajectory of China's conflict behavior, including its approach to deterrence, crisis management and the use of force. To explore these important questions in China's international relations, this seminar examines the evolution of Chinese strategic thought, in primary sources as well as its reflection in the interactions among Chinese states and between China and other states. To understand the degree of continuity between the past and the present, the majority of the course will explore the evolution of strategic thought in ancient and imperial China, while the role of strategy in modern and contemporary China will be examined in the final sessions. The seminar will focus on a close reading of classic Chinese texts on strategy, such as Sun Zi's <em>Art of War</em> and Mao Zedong's writings, along with relevant secondary literature on diplomatic, military and intellectual history.</p> <p>The course has several goals. The first is to introduce students to the content of Chinese strategic thought in order to understand the degree of continuity and discontinuity reflected in subsequent theory and practice. The second goal is to consider the extent to which China may be described as possessing a unique strategic culture or approach to strategy.</p> <p>The seminar will raise many questions, but few may be answered decisively. Students will be expected to read widely and wrestle with concepts, not just accumulate facts. The reading load is heavy and students must complete all the assignments for each session. Class meetings will emphasize discussion, not lectures.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Requirements and Grading</h2> <div class=\"maintabletemplate\"><table class=\"tablewidth50\" summary=\"See table caption for summary.\"> <caption class=\"invisible\">Grading criteria.</caption> <thead align=\"left\"> <tr> <th scope=\"col\">ACTIVITIES</th> <th scope=\"col\">PERCENTAGES</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody align=\"left\"> <tr class=\"row\"> <td>Class participation</td> <td>50%</td> </tr> <tr class=\"alt-row\"> <td>Research paper</td> <td>50%</td> </tr> </tbody> </table></div> <p>The first requirement is active participation in seminar discussion. A successful seminar requires attendance at every meeting, completion of all readings, and active and engaged participation in the class. To stimulate discussion, students may be assigned to give short presentations on assigned readings or to serve as &quot;resident expert&quot; for that week's readings. The second requirement is a research paper on the topic of your choice.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Information for Undergraduates</h2> <p>This course is open to graduate students and advanced undergraduates with a background in China and international relations. Undergraduates will be evaluated along the same criteria; class participation (50%) and a research paper (50%). Undergraduates may choose a second grading option, substituting two take take-home essays, each roughly 15 pages in length, for the research paper. These essays must demonstrate a command of the readings in the course.</p> <div class=\"help slide-bottom\"> <div class=\"help-message\"> <a class=\"help-engage\" href=\"javascript: trackEvents('Bottom Get Started','bottom get started Click','Help Overlay');\">Need help getting started?</a> <a href=\"javascript:disableHelpPopup(); trackEvents('Bottom Don\\'t Show','bottom don\\'t show Click','Help Overlay');\" class=\"help-dismiss\">Don't show me this again</a> </div> </div> <div class=\"help popup-center\"> <div class=\"help-message\"> <p class=\"help-dismiss\"><a href=\"javascript:disableHelpPopup(); trackEvents('Popup Don\\'t Show','popup don\\'t show Click','Help Overlay');\">Don't show me this again</a></p> <h2>Welcome!</h2> <p>This is one of over 2,200 courses on OCW.

Specifically, your argument can dispute argument(s) advanced in the reading or lectures; can concur with argument(s) advanced in the reading or lectures; can assess or explain policies or historical events described in the reading and lectures; or can address current events that are relevant to course materials or issues. In other words, your choice of topic is quite open. Evaluation of policies or ideas covered in the reading or lecture is encouraged. Somewhere in your papersâpreferably at the beginningâplease offer a 1-2 sentence summary of your argument. These papers will not be graded but are mandatory and must be completed to receive full credit for class participation.</p> <p>We require that you submit a finished draft of at least one of your longer papers a week before its due date in order to get comments for rewrite from your TA, and/or the 17.42 writing tutor. You are wise to submit all longer papers to your TA early for commentsâyou'll learn from it! So please leave yourself time to get comments on drafts of your longer papers from your TAs before you submit final drafts.</p> <p>Before writing your papers, please familiarize yourself with the rules of citing sources (to be handed out) and make sure you follow them.

I will circulate a list of study questions before the final. The final exam questions will be drawn from this list. Students are encouraged to study together to prepare their answers. The final will also include short-answer questions that will not be distributed in advance.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Films: The 17.42 Film Society</h2> <p>A couple of optional evening film-showings will be organized during the term on topics to be chosen by acclamation of the class.

Beginning with an analysis of the strategic and environmental legacies of the 20th Century, it explores the politicization of the natural environment, the role of science in this process, and the gradual shifts in political concerns to incorporate &quot;nature&quot;. Two general thrusts of climate-politics connections are pursued, namely those related to (a) conflict â focusing on threats to security due to environmental dislocations and (b) cooperation â focusing on the politics of international treaties that have contributed to emergent processes for global accord in response to evidence of climate change. The course concludes by addressing the question of: &quot;What Next?&quot;</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Prerequisites</h2> <p>There are no prerequisites for this course.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Required Texts</h2> <p><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0262621495/ref=nosim/mitopencourse-20\"><img src=\"/images/a_logo_17.gif\" alt=\"Buy at Amazon\" align=\"absMiddle\" border=\"0\" /></a> Luterbacher, Urs, and Detlef F.

Yet, what motivates people to act collectively? And, are their efforts likely to be successful? Is there such a thing as &quot;people power&quot; that matters to how we explain political, economic, and social change?</p> <p>This course seeks to provide students with a general understanding of the form of collective action known as the social movement. Our task will be guided by the close examination of several twentieth century social movements in the United States. We will read about the U.S. civil rights, the unemployed workers', welfare rights, pro-choice / pro-life and gay rights movements. We will compare and contrast certain of these movements with their counterparts in other countries. For all, we will identify the reasons for their successes and failures.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Course Requirements</h2> <p>Classroom participation is a basic requirement of this course. Contributing usefully to classroom discussions requires that students read the assigned texts. There will be one take-home essay (3-5 pages), one in-class mid-term exam and one final research paper. The research paper (8-10 pages) may be on a social movement not covered by the course materials or on some aspect of the course's concerns. Students will present their papers during the final class meetings on session 9. It is strongly advised that students meet individually with the instructor to discuss their paper topics.The final grade will be calculated as follows:</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Grading</h2> <div class=\"maintabletemplate\"> <table class=\"tablewidth50\" summary=\"See table caption for summary.\"> <caption class=\"invisible\">Course grading.</caption> <thead align=\"left\"> <tr> <th scope=\"col\">ACTIVITIES</th> <th scope=\"col\">PERCENTAGES</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody align=\"left\"> <tr class=\"row\"> <td>Classroom Participation</td> <td>20%</td> </tr> <tr class=\"alt-row\"> <td>Midterm In-class Exam</td> <td>20%</td> </tr> <tr class=\"row\"> <td>Take-home Essay</td> <td>25%</td> </tr> <tr class=\"alt-row\"> <td>Final Research Paper</td> <td>35%</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> </div> <div class=\"help slide-bottom\"> <div class=\"help-message\"> <a class=\"help-engage\" href=\"javascript: trackEvents('Bottom Get Started','bottom get started Click','Help Overlay');\">Need help getting started?</a> <a href=\"javascript:disableHelpPopup(); trackEvents('Bottom Don\\'t Show','bottom don\\'t show Click','Help Overlay');\" class=\"help-dismiss\">Don't show me this again</a> </div> </div> <div class=\"help popup-center\"> <div class=\"help-message\"> <p class=\"help-dismiss\"><a href=\"javascript:disableHelpPopup(); trackEvents('Popup Don\\'t Show','popup don\\'t show Click','Help Overlay');\">Don't show me this again</a></p> <h2>Welcome!</h2> <p>This is one of over 2,200 courses on OCW.

This course seeks to answer fundamental questions about racial and ethnic politics. To begin, what are the bases of ethnic and racial identities? What accounts for political mobilization based upon such identities? What are the political claims and goals of such mobilization and is conflict between groups and/or with government forces inevitable? How do ethnic and racial identities intersect with other identities, such as gender and class, which are themselves the sources of social, political, and economic cleavages? Finally, how are domestic ethnic/racial politics connected to international human rights? To answer these questions, the course begins with an introduction to dominant theoretical approaches to racial and ethnic identity. The course then considers these approaches in light of current events in Africa, Asia, Latin America, Europe, and the United States.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Course Requirements</h2> <p>Regular attendance, completion of all reading assignments, and consistent class participation are required of all students. Written requirements include two (5-7 page), double spaced analytic essays and one final (7-10 page) essay. Topics for essays will be distributed by the instructor.

You can do so through footnotes, bibliography, or some other kind of scholarly apparatus. Failure to disclose your reliance on the research or thinking of others is PLAGIARISM, which is considered to be the most serious academic offense and will be treated as such. If you have any questions about how you should document the sources of your ideas, please ask your instructors <strong>before</strong> you submit your written work.

Some of the key issues that will be explored include:</p> <ul> <li> Is globalization really a new phenomenon? </li> <li> Is it irreversible? </li> <li> What are effects on wages and inequality, on social safety nets, on production, and innovation? </li> <li> How does it affect relations between developed countries and developing countries? </li> <li> How does globalization affect democracy? </li> </ul> <p>The seminar is open to undergraduates and graduate students. Some prior work in political science or economics is strongly recommended. For undergraduates there will be an additional one-section meeting (one hour) to be scheduled at the first meeting of the class. Graduate students will be expected to do most of the recommended as well as the assigned readings. The requirements for undergraduates and graduate students are:</p> <ol> <li> To complete each week's assigned reading before class; </li> <li> Two essays on assigned topics. </li> </ol> <p>The papers require thinking about issues raised in readings and class discussion. They should be between 12 to 15 typed double-spaced pages.

Together they are intended to provide theoretical, empirical, and policy perspectives on source and consequences of globalization, focusing on emergent structures and processes, and on the implications of flows of goods and services across national boundaries â with special attention to the issue of migration, on the assumption that people matter and matter a lot. An important concern addressed pertains to the dilemmas of international policies that are shaped by the macro-level consequences of micro-level behavior.</p> <p>Part I defines the dimensions of globalization. The focus is on empirical evidence, propositions about the 'causal logic', cross-border issues, and evolving policy dilemmas. A conceptual distinction is made between conventional views of globalization shaped by the perspectives and priorities of comparative politics as a field that focus largely on the integration of national economies, and those of international relations, shaped by the priorities of the IR/IPE field -- addressing security and sovereignty issues that transcend national boundaries, question the implications of these boundaries as traditionally defined, and contribute to the transformation of inter-state, supra-state, and non-state relations.</p> <p>Part II is on crossing borders and focuses on sources, consequences, and modalities of migrations. The intent is to integrate a hitherto missing dimension of the study of international relations, namely the mobility of people â individually or collectively â and their implications for the configuration of the international system and relations among state and non-state actors. Special attention is given to matters of security, to the configuration of state systems and to sources and consequences of international conflict.</p> <p>Part III is on the processes by which changes take place in the international domain, influenced by emergent sources and consequences of globalization â and its particular manifestation in patterns of population movements. Particular attention is given to insights from international relations theory and IPE theory and policy of understanding institutional challenges and responses that transcend the conventional frame of the state system defined by territorial boundaries. The concluding session reviews known legacies of the 20th century to date â given emergent understandings of the complexity of globalization.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Course Requirements</h2> <p>The course requirements consist of:</p> <ul> <li>the Reading assignments,</li> <li>Class Participation and discussion (which includes discussions of the Readings), and</li> <li>Written requirement.</li> </ul> <p>There are two options for meeting the Written Requirements:</p> <h3 class=\"subsubhead\">Option A</h3> <ul> <li>Take Home Midterm</li> <li>Take Home Final Examination</li> </ul> <h3 class=\"subsubhead\">Option B</h3> <ul> <li>Paper, Short Statement, Outline, Presentation</li> <li>Final Paper (no less than 30 pages)</li> </ul> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Required Texts</h2> <p><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1551112809/ref=nosim/mitopencourse-20\"><img alt=\"Buy at Amazon\" src=\"/images/a_logo_17.gif\" align=\"absMiddle\" border=\"0\" /></a> Brawley, Mark R. <em>The Politics of Globalization</em>.

The basic orientation is disciplinary and comparative (over time and across countries, regions, firms), spanning issues relevant to both industrial and developing states. Special attention is given to challenges and dilemmas shaped by the macro-level consequences of micro-level behavior, and by micro-level adjustments to macro-level influences.</p> <p>The first part of the course is on basic concepts and theoretical foundations, and covers assumptions and implications. The focus is on core economic principles and structural approaches, positive international political economy, and institutional approaches â leading to the articulation of complexity and introducing 'globalization' perspectives and contentions. The goal is to understand how theory is framed and 'works', the potential inferences and the contentions. The second part of the course draws on the theoretical foundations by 'using' concepts to examine a set of specific international exchanges, and related structures and processes. These include sources of 'demand', technology advances and the 'new' knowledge economy, trade and finance, firms and global markets. The third part converges on interactions of globalization and localization, political economy of the Internet and new e-markets and the fundamentals of 'sustainability' that question some of the core assumptions discussed in the first part of the course and 'utilized' in the second. The course concludes with analyses of select international institutional innovations.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Course Requirement</h2> <p>There are two major course requirements:</p> <p>First is the nature and extent of class discussion and participation (40% of final grade).</p> <p>Second is a choice of (a) take home final exam (b) one research paper â long paper, or (c) three short review essays covering the individual parts of the course (60% of final grade).</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Required Texts</h2> <p>Alt, James E., and Kenneth A.

Course readings cover both substantive and methods topics. Four substantive topics are covered:</p> <ol> <li>major theories of American foreign policy;</li> <li>major episodes in the history of American foreign policy and historical/interpretive controversies about them;</li> <li>the evaluation of major past American foreign policies--were their results good or bad? and</li> <li>current policy controversies, including means of evaluating proposed policies.</li> </ol> <p>Three methods topics are covered:</p> <ol> <li>basic social scientific inference--what are theories? what are good theories? how should theories be framed and tested?</li> <li>historical investigative methodology, including archival research, and, most importantly,</li> <li>case study methodology.</li> </ol> <p>Historical episodes covered in the course are used as raw material for case studies, asking &quot;if these episodes were the subject of case studies, how should those studies be performed, and what could be learned from them?&quot;</p> <p>This is a graduate course, open to undergraduates by permission of the instructor only.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Course Requirements</h2> <p>Students will be asked to write 2 short papers (6-10 page typed doublespaced pages) and two 1-page exercises. One of the 6-10 page papers will be a case study; the other can be a case study or a policy evaluation. The 1-page exercises are due on Session 2 and Session 5; the papers are due on Session 11 and Session 13.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Grading</h2> <p>The course grade is determined by performance on 2 (6-10 page) papers and by the quality of in-class participation.

Course readings cover theoretical, historical, and methodological topics. Major theories of war are explored and assessed in the first few weeks of the class, asking at each stage &quot;are these good theories?&quot; and &quot;how could they be tested?&quot; Basic social scientific inference -- what are theories? What are good theories? How should theories be framed and tested? -- and case study methodology are also discussed. The second half of the course explores the history of the outbreak of some major wars. We use these cases as raw material for case studies, asking &quot;if these episodes were the subject of case studies, how should those studies be performed, and what could be learned from them?&quot;</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Course requirements</h2> <p>Students will write two short papers (6-10 typed doublespaced pages) and two 1-page exercises.

While scholars have recognized that territory has been one of the most frequent issues over which states go to war, territorial conflicts have only recently become the subject of systematic study. This course will examine why territorial conflicts arise in the first place, why some of these conflicts escalate to high levels of violence and why other territorial disputes reach settlement, thereby reducing the likelihood of war. Readings in the course draw upon political geography and history as well as qualitative and quantitative approaches to political science. Undergraduates may enroll with the instructor's permission.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Requirements</h2> <p>The main requirement for this seminar is a research paper on a topic to be agreed upon in consultation with the instructor. As a seminar, the other requirement for this course is to participate in class discussion. The success of any seminar depends on the degree to which members of the seminar prepare readings in advance and actively participate in the discussion.

Grand strategy is the collection of political and military means and ends with which a state attempts to achieve security. We will examine strategic developments in the years preceding World Wars I and II, and how those developments played themselves out in these wars. The following questions will guide the inquiry: What is grand strategy and what are its critical aspects? What recurring factors have exerted the greatest influence on the strategies of the states selected for study? How may the quality of a grand strategy be judged? What consequences seem to follow from grand strategies of different types? A second theme of the course is methodological. We will pay close attention to how comparative historical case studies are conducted.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Course Requirements</h2> <p>Two papers based on the class reading will be required. These are to be critical essays. They shall be no longer than 7 pages; no creative line-spacing, margins, or character formats please. A comprehensive take-home final exam will account for 50% of the grade. In the early weeks of the term about half of classroom time is lecture and half is discussion. As the term progresses, an increasing percentage of class time will be devoted to discussion. Participation in classroom discussion is much appreciated; silence is noted.</p> <p>The papers are meant to be think pieces, but not day-dreaming pieces. The first paper covers the foundational conceptual material of the course. This paper could take one or more arguments apart and examine them for logical consistency, completeness, clarity, and evidence. It could compare and contrast two or more theoretical arguments according to several of the aforementioned criteria. It could apply one or more theories to a substantive problem already well known to the student (and thus requiring no further research), as a vehicle toward a critique of the theoretical arguments. The second paper covers the substantive material on World War I. Thus it should involve application of the theoretical and conceptual material from part I of the course, to some of the world war I case material. The most self organizing and straightforward approach would test one or more theories against some of this case material. Extra reading is permitted but not required for this paper. Students should review the topics of these papers with me. The best way to do so is to send me a brief one paragraph summary of the plan.</p> <div class=\"help slide-bottom\"> <div class=\"help-message\"> <a class=\"help-engage\" href=\"javascript: trackEvents('Bottom Get Started','bottom get started Click','Help Overlay');\">Need help getting started?</a> <a href=\"javascript:disableHelpPopup(); trackEvents('Bottom Don\\'t Show','bottom don\\'t show Click','Help Overlay');\" class=\"help-dismiss\">Don't show me this again</a> </div> </div> <div class=\"help popup-center\"> <div class=\"help-message\"> <p class=\"help-dismiss\"><a href=\"javascript:disableHelpPopup(); trackEvents('Popup Don\\'t Show','popup don\\'t show Click','Help Overlay');\">Don't show me this again</a></p> <h2>Welcome!</h2> <p>This is one of over 2,200 courses on OCW.

It examines the political, military, and economic challenges facing Japan, its neighbors, and the international system under conditions of great uncertainty. Topics range from the history of once &quot;new&quot; world orders to theories that inform our understanding of international affairs and foreign policy decision-making, as each is related to Japan. We focus on Japanese bilateral, regional, and global security policies from a range of theoretical perspectives.

The course is divided into three sections. The first covers general theory and discusses the social construction of ethnicity as well as the limits of construction. The second section discusses ethnicity as a dependent variable. This section studies the forces that shape the development of ethnic identities and their motivating power. The third section addresses ethnicity as an independent variable. In other words, it focuses on how ethnicity operates to affect important political and economic outcomes.</p> <p>This course is the first semester of a year-long sequence on ethnic politics. However, each semester is self-contained and students may take the course in either or both semesters. Ethnic Politics I aims for breadth over depth. It covers many works in the âcanonâ of texts on ethnic politics as well as addressing many major topics (modernization, entrepreneurship, prejudice, ethnic party formation, etc.) in one week sessions. Ethnic Politics II covers some of these topics in greater depth and also requires a major research paper.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Requirements and Grading</h2> <p>The course requires a series of short to medium length papers.</p> <p>Six 2-page papers will be used to focus discussion on specific works, three 5-7 page papers are due after each section of the course, and an 8-10 page final paper is due at the end of the course. Students are also required to attend at least one meeting of the &quot;Divided Cities Seminar.&quot;</p> <p>Class discussion will account for the remaining part of the grade.

While <a href=\"/courses/political-science/17-504-ethnic-politics-i-fall-2003\">17.504 Ethnic Politics I</a> is designed as a primarily theoretical course, Ethnic Politics II switches the focus to methods.</p> <p>Graduate students specializing in any subfield are encouraged to take this subject, regardless of their previous empirical or theoretical background. <a href=\"/courses/political-science/17-504-ethnic-politics-i-fall-2003\">Ethnic Politics I</a> and Ethnic Politics II are designed as a year long sequence but need not be taken in order. Each class can stand alone, although it is helpful to take them in sequence.</p> <h3 class=\"subsubhead\">Course Goals</h3> <p>The course aims to familiarize the student with the current conventional approaches as well as major challenges to them. The course discusses definition and measurement issues as well as briefly addressing survey techniques and modeling.</p> <p>This subject has three goals:</p> <ul> <li>introduce students to the classic works on ethnic politics</li> <li>familiarize students with new research and methodological innovations in the study of ethnic politics</li> <li>help students design and execute original research projects related to ethnic politics</li> </ul> <h3 class=\"subsubhead\">Readings</h3> <p>Readings have been drawn from across disciplines, including political science, anthropology, sociology, and economics. Students read across the four subfields within political science.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Course Requirements and Grading</h2> <p>There will be a variety of short assignments. The major requirement is a 20-30 page research paper.

It is assumed that students have either a regional interest in nationalist politics and/or theoretical interest that will guide them in their selection of a paper topic. For example, one paper option would be to use one or more case studies to examine a theoretically-grounded question or claim about nationalism. While it is expected that students will draw heavily upon secondary sources, the use of primary sources is strongly encouraged. Paper proposals (7 - 10 pages) will be distributed among classmates and discussed in class. The proposals should be a concise statement of the question(s) that will guide the research as well as the methods and evidence proposed to answer the question(s). Bibliographies are required. Final papers (or well-developed drafts thereof) will be discussed on the two final class meetings.</p> <p>In addition, each student will be assigned to present the week's readings. Such presentations will be followed by class discussion. Students may prepare handouts, but they are not required. Finally, it is expected that those students who have already developed an interest in a particular region or set of cases should be prepared to discuss how the readings apply (or not) to their chosen areas.</p> <div class=\"help slide-bottom\"> <div class=\"help-message\"> <a class=\"help-engage\" href=\"javascript: trackEvents('Bottom Get Started','bottom get started Click','Help Overlay');\">Need help getting started?</a> <a href=\"javascript:disableHelpPopup(); trackEvents('Bottom Don\\'t Show','bottom don\\'t show Click','Help Overlay');\" class=\"help-dismiss\">Don't show me this again</a> </div> </div> <div class=\"help popup-center\"> <div class=\"help-message\"> <p class=\"help-dismiss\"><a href=\"javascript:disableHelpPopup(); trackEvents('Popup Don\\'t Show','popup don\\'t show Click','Help Overlay');\">Don't show me this again</a></p> <h2>Welcome!</h2> <p>This is one of over 2,200 courses on OCW.

Relying on the influential texts of Lasswell, Huntington, and Finer, the first classes clarify the basic tensions between the military and civilians. A wide-ranging series of case studies follows. These cases are chosen to create a field of variation that includes states with stable civilian rule, states with stable military influence, and states exhibiting fluctuations between military and civilian control. The final three weeks of the course are devoted to the broader relationship between military and society.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Requirements</h2> <ul> <li> As the course is a seminar, class attendance and participation are critical. </li> <li> The major requirement is a comparative research paper (20-30 pages long). In this paper, students must systematically compare civilian control mechanisms (or their absence) across at least two countries. Other projects are subject to approval by the instructor. </li> <li> Students will also be required to make oral presentations and to write short position papers. </li> </ul> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Grading</h2> <p>The research paper will account for half of the grade.

In the week that they are assigned to be class discussants, students will have to critically review the assigned readings and give a 15 minute presentation of the general points made by the authors, highlighting the related as well as conflicting arguments, and underlying the respective works' analytical strengths and weaknesses. Discussant assignments will be made the first week of class. A 2-3 page memo on the points that are intended to be discussed should be emailed to the instructor by midnight on the day before the class presentation.</p> <p>Students will also have to write a 20-30 page paper due during the last week of class. The paper can be a research design paper or a draft of a paper intended for publication. If it is the latter, it should contain a theoretical argument and an empirical test of that argument. Paper topics must be based on one of the main themes of the course and approved by the instructor. A one-page description of the paper topic will be due in Ses #6 of class and a 15-minute presentation for class feedback in Ses #9.

Even management majors are mostly looking toward &quot;analyst&quot; jobs on Wall Street or in consulting firms. Although finding a job and succeeding <strong>in the first few years</strong> is largely dependent on your technical skills, as the quote from Dana Mead suggests, succeeding both in your first job and in your career depends partly on how well you can deal with organizations and the people in them. Each of you will work in organizations (hi-tech start-ups, medium and large corporations, government labs, universities) of varying sizes and characteristics. Over one-half of you will become <strong>managers</strong> even if you do not take graduate management training.</p> <p>This course introduces you to behavioral science theories, methods, and tools and provides opportunities to use and apply them to problems you will encounter in your work and career. The behavioral approach includes knowledge about human behavior in general as well as behavior in work settings, a set of techniques or research methods used to find out about human behavior in a systematic way, and communications, teamwork, negotiations, conflict resolution, leadership and organizational analysis skills needed to be effective in the modern workplace. It is expected that at the end of the course you will: (a) know something about managerial psychology, (b) know how to learn more, (c) understand the behavioral research process, (d) develop skills in presenting your ideas in oral and written reports.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Format</h2> <p>The class meets in lecture twice a week. Most of the lectures will present frameworks and descriptions about the psychology and sociology of organizations and the institutional context of work and careers. The course material will begin with an overview of work and organizations in modern industrial society, and then examine individual behavior, move to behavior in groups or teams, and finally discuss organizations as a whole.</p> <p>Once a week, the class will meet in small sections. Sections will be used primarily to teach statistics and research methods, manage the group research projects (discussed later), and fulfill the communication requirement. However, classes may also discuss lecture material and readings, carry out experiential exercises and case discussions, and assign homework.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">15.301 and 15.310</h2> <p>15.301 is a 15-unit course that includes a team project and assignments that fulfill the Communication Requirement. 15.310 is a 9-unit course that covers the same content but does not include the team project, nor does it fulfill the Communication Requirement. Students taking 15.310 attend the same lectures each week at 15.301, but they have a separate section meeting that will discuss cases and experiential exercises rather than statistics and research projects.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Textbooks</h2> <p>There are two books that students should purchase:</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0131447467/ref=nosim/mitopencourse-20\"><img border=\"0\" align=\"absMiddle\" src=\"/images/a_logo_17.gif\" alt=\"Buy at Amazon\" /></a> Greenberg, Jerald. <em>Managing Behavior in Organizations</em>. 4th ed. Upper Saddle River, NJ: Prentice Hall, 2004. ISBN: 9780131447462.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0321011473/ref=nosim/mitopencourse-20\"><img border=\"0\" align=\"absMiddle\" src=\"/images/a_logo_17.gif\" alt=\"Buy at Amazon\" /></a> Cialdini, Robert B. <em>Influence: Science and Practice</em>. 4th ed. Boston, MA: Allyn and Bacon, 2000. ISBN: 9780321011473.</p> <p>This is a really well-written set of principles and examples of getting people to do things. We will use these essential ideas and skills to satisfy the Communications Requirement as well as to enrich the course.</p> <p>In addition, there will be a course packet of additional required readings, and another one that has the readings assigned for recitation.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Grading</h2> <h3 class=\"subsubhead\">Quizzes</h3> <p>There will be two quizzes that will cover readings and lecture material. The first quiz is a take-home that requires three 1-2 page essays. The second quiz will be in-class and will include some multiple choice and short answer questions.</p> <h3 class=\"subsubhead\">Participation and Presentations</h3> <p>15.310 will count participation both in class and in recitation. Two students will be assigned to each case, one will be responsible to present the case and the other to bring forth examples from previous experiences that illustrate or contrast with the situation described in the case. The cases will be assigned during the first recitation.</p> <h3 class=\"subsubhead\">Paper</h3> <p>There will be an individual paper. The details are in the <a href=\"/courses/sloan-school-of-management/15-301-managerial-psychology-fall-2006/assignments\">assignments</a> section.</p> <h3 class=\"subsubhead\">Email Assignments</h3> <p>There will be an assignment for each recitation that will be due on the Thursday before the recitation at midnight. These are 300 to 500 words long and should be sent to your TA. No late email assignments will be accepted. These will be graded as &quot;better than most&quot;, &quot;typical&quot;, and &quot;weaker than most&quot;.</p> <h3 class=\"subsubhead\">Grading for 15.310</h3> <div class=\"maintabletemplate\"><table summary=\"See table caption for summary.\" class=\"tablewidth50\"> <caption class=\"invisible\">Grading criteria.</caption> <thead align=\"left\"> <tr> <th scope=\"col\">ACTIVITIES</th> <th scope=\"col\">PERCENTAGES</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody align=\"left\"> <tr class=\"row\"> <td>Individual paper</td> <td>20%</td> </tr> <tr class=\"alt-row\"> <td>Quiz #1</td> <td>15%</td> </tr> <tr class=\"row\"> <td>Quiz #2</td> <td>15%</td> </tr> <tr class=\"alt-row\"> <td>Class participation</td> <td>10%</td> </tr> <tr class=\"row\"> <td>Recitation participation</td> <td>10%</td> </tr> <tr class=\"alt-row\"> <td>Email assignments</td> <td>25%</td> </tr> <tr class=\"row\"> <td>Case presentation</td> <td>5%</td> </tr> <tr class=\"alt-row\"> <td>Total</td> <td>100%</td> </tr> </tbody> </table></div> <p> </p><h2 class=\"subhead\">Class Participation and Conduct</h2> <p>Your class participation will be evaluated subjectively, but will rely upon measures of punctuality, attendance, familiarity with the required readings, relevance and insight reflected in classroom questions, and commentary. Although the class is taught in lecture mode, I will rely heavily upon interactive discussion within the class. I expect students to be familiar with the readings, even though they might not understand all of the material in advance. Questions and comments are strongly encouraged.</p> <h3 class=\"subsubhead\">Class Participation Includes Punctuality in Attendance</h3> <p>We expect you to arrive, be seated, and be ready for class on time, and to stay in class for the entire session. Arriving late is inconsiderate to fellow students as well as to the instructor. Latecomers also miss announcements, handouts, and the initial set-up of the class topic. We ask that you use a name card for the first few weeks until we learn your names.</p> <h3 class=\"subsubhead\">Class Participation also Includes Maintaining a Professional Atmosphere in Class</h3> <p>This means no computer use in class unless specifically required, and refraining from distracting activities during class (side conversations or games). Cold calls may be directed at a student who walks in late or seems to be inattentive in class.</p> <p>We may call on you periodically to answer questions about either the homework or classroom developments. Cold calls may be chosen randomly from all students, or directed at students who have not spoken in a while. We will evaluate your classroom participation on the basis of the extent to which you contribute to the learning environment. Disagreeing with the professor is ok, as long as we remain respectful of each other. Asking what appear to be &quot;dumb questions&quot; about what is being covered is also ok: very often half of the class will have the same questions in mind and be relieved to have them asked.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Policy on Individual Work</h2> <p>Except for the team project assignments, written homework must represent your own <strong>individual</strong> work. Copying or otherwise using any other outside materials on an assignment without proper citation and reference constitutes a violation called <strong>plagiarism</strong> (for more information please visit: <a href=\"http://libguides.mit.edu/content.php?pid=80743&amp;sid=598642#1885811\">MIT Libraries</a>). Any student who copies or knowingly allows his/her work to be copied or who uses outside materials in the preparation of assignments without proper citation and reference will receive an F grade for the assignment. Similar papers may not be submitted to separate courses without explicit prior approval of both instructors. During exams, any student who either receives or knowingly gives assistance or information concerning the exam will receive an F grade on the exam.</p> <p>MIT's reputation as a great university and the source of important original research rests on having the highest standards of Academic Integrity. The above violations of the Policy on Individual Work are also violations of MIT's Standards of Academic Integrity. Such cases may be brought before the MIT Committee on Discipline. Every year over a dozen such cases are brought against undergraduates and graduate students who turn in work that is copied from other students, from internet sites or other sources, or used without proper citation. In many of these cases the students have been <strong>suspended</strong> from MIT, had their degrees withheld, and had notations placed on their permanent transcripts.</p> <div class=\"help slide-bottom\"> <div class=\"help-message\"> <a class=\"help-engage\" href=\"javascript: trackEvents('Bottom Get Started','bottom get started Click','Help Overlay');\">Need help getting started?</a> <a href=\"javascript:disableHelpPopup(); trackEvents('Bottom Don\\'t Show','bottom don\\'t show Click','Help Overlay');\" class=\"help-dismiss\">Don't show me this again</a> </div> </div> <div class=\"help popup-center\"> <div class=\"help-message\"> <p class=\"help-dismiss\"><a href=\"javascript:disableHelpPopup(); trackEvents('Popup Don\\'t Show','popup don\\'t show Click','Help Overlay');\">Don't show me this again</a></p> <h2>Welcome!</h2> <p>This is one of over 2,200 courses on OCW.

They are responsible for grading most of the written assignments and exams. Schedule of their office hours will be announced on the first day of class.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Office Visitations</h2> <p>If you have been attending class and help sessions but are still falling behind you are encouraged to visit us. These meetings will be much more productive if you come well prepared with specific questions. In addition, be familiar with the definitions and notation related to a topic even if you are having conceptual difficulties. Most importantly, don't tell us that you understand something when you are still perplexed. Please make appointments by email.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Grading Procedure</h2> <p>Your grade will be based on the following weights:</p> <div class=\"maintabletemplate\"> <table summary=\"Course Table Listing\" class=\"tablewidth50\"> <thead align=\"left\"> <tr class=\"tableheader\"> <th scope=\"col\" id=\"col1\">ACTIVITIES</th> <th scope=\"col\" id=\"col2\">PERCENTAGES</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody align=\"left\"> <tr class=\"row\"> <td headers=\"col1\">Contributions to Class Discussion</td> <td headers=\"col2\">10%</td> </tr> <tr class=\"alt-row\"> <td headers=\"col1\">Written Problem Sets (best 7 of 8)</td> <td headers=\"col2\">10%</td> </tr> <tr class=\"row\"> <td headers=\"col1\">First Exam</td> <td headers=\"col2\">20%</td> </tr> <tr class=\"alt-row\"> <td headers=\"col1\">Second Exam</td> <td headers=\"col2\">20%</td> </tr> <tr class=\"row\"> <td headers=\"col1\">Final Exam</td> <td headers=\"col2\">40%</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> </div> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Individual versus Group Assignments</h2> <p>The problem sets are to be done individually and are intended to help you learn and practice the mechanics of the course material. By this, we mean that the work you turn in must be your own, as opposed to copied from another. This does not mean you have to do individual assignments in isolation. We expect that you will need to consult each other in order to understand, or better understand, the material. Seeking and giving such assistance is encouraged.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Regrade Policy</h2> <p>If you believe an error has been made in grading your homework or exam, you may request a regrade by doing the following: Write a brief note to your TA explaining why you think there is an error and submit both the note and the entire assignment or exam to which it pertains. All regrade requests must occur within seven (7) calendar days of the day graded material is returned to the class. We reserve the right to regrade the entire contents of any submitted assignment or exam.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Bulletin Board</h2> <p>We will use the bulletin board to extend the class discussion outside of the space-time constraints of the class. Your TA's and I will actively participate in all ongoing discussion threads. This should be a less threatening place to engage your classmates in discussions of course topics. To encourage all to participate, contributions to the bulletin boards will be counted towards your class participation points. Other aspects of &quot;class participation&quot; will be discussed on the first day of class.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Assignments</h2> <p>Unless otherwise noted, problem sets must be submitted before the start of the class of the due date. Note on text problems: &quot;<strong>Do</strong>&quot; are problems that will help you prepare for class; but they do not have to be submitted. &quot;<strong>Opt</strong>&quot; are problems that you could optionally do if you want more material to study.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Course Materials</h2> <h3 class=\"subsubhead\">Required Text</h3> <p><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0470000465/ref=nosim/mitopencourse-20\"><img border=\"0\" align=\"absmiddle\" src=\"/images/a_logo_17.gif\" alt=\"Buy at Amazon\" /></a> Pratt, J. <em>Financial Accounting in an Economic Context</em>. 5th ed.

Companies and managers regularly confront law-sensitive issues that are crucial to the company's future and the manager's career. Experienced managers bring to these situations an awareness of how law structures opportunities and risks, and enough understanding of law to make good use of professional advice. I offer several law courses at Sloan, and each provides those skills. My goal is not to impart technical legal knowledge, but to enhance the judgment students will bring to their responsibilities as entrepreneurs, managers in established companies, and consultants.</p> <h3 class=\"subsubhead\">Picking a law course:</h3> <p>Many Sloan students take a law course, but most of those take just one. The law courses I offer are not in any sequence. None is a prerequisite for any other, and each of my courses provides certain basic law-related analytic skills. However, each also has its own distinctive focus, and some are broader-gauged than others.</p> <h3 class=\"subsubhead\">What we cover in 15.615/15.647:</h3> <p>This is a broad-gauged course. We discuss the basic framework of business law, and then follow a new firm from the &quot;breakaway&quot; from an established company through organizing and financing the new venture. We later consider going public, selling the company, and bankruptcy. Along the way, we examine a wide range of law-sensitive issues including intellectual property, employment law, business disputes, mergers and acquisitions, international trade, contracts, products liability, and white-collar crime.</p> <p>15.647 is the first half of the course (H1), and emphasizes organizing and financing the new firm. It is recommended only if your schedule does not permit taking 615.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Requirements</h2> <h3 class=\"subsubhead\">Take-home exercises:</h3> <p>There are two take-home exercises for 615. Enrollees in 647 do only the first. Students have three hours for an exercise, and some choice as to the particular three-hour period.</p> <p>During the period the exercises are available, students may not consult with each other about the course. During the exercise, a student may consult only the text and the readings, and any notes prepared by that individual student. (Please keep this last restriction in mind when preparing study notes.)</p> <p>The exercises heavily emphasize the required readings. The questions and format will be similar to previous years (although the exercises from some past years were 5 hours long, not three).</p> <p>I use the take-home format so that a student does not have to write fast to do well. This may be of special importance for students for whom English is a second language. It is not expected that students will need the full three hours to complete the exercise.</p> <p></p><h3 class=\"subsubhead\">Class participation and &quot;on-deck&quot; preparation:</h3> <p></p><p>All students are expected to participate in class discussion. In addition, for each class, some students will be assigned in advance to be &quot;on-deck.&quot; &quot;On-deck&quot; students prepare with special care and are ready to respond to questions about the readings.

Our objective is to give you a working knowledge of the analytical tools that bear most directly on the economic decisions firms must regularly make. We will emphasize market structure and industrial performance, including the strategic interaction of firms. We will examine the behavior of individual markets -- and the producers and consumers that sell and buy in those markets -- in some detail, focusing on cost analysis, the determinants of market demand, pricing strategy, market power, and the implications of government regulatory policies. We will also examine the implications of economics on other business practices, such as incentive plans, auctions, and transfer pricing.</p> <h3 class=\"subsubhead\">Readings</h3> <p>The assigned readings in this course have been selected to provide a balance of principles, tools, and applications; they are detailed in the <a href=\"/courses/sloan-school-of-management/15-010-economic-analysis-for-business-decisions-fall-2004/readings\">readings</a> section. The basic text for the course is: <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0130165832/ref=nosim/mitopencourse-20\"><img alt=\"Buy at Amazon\" src=\"/images/a_logo_17.gif\" align=\"absMiddle\" border=\"0\" /></a> Pindyck, Robert S., and Daniel L. Rubinfeld. <em>Microeconomics.</em> 5th ed. Upper Saddle River, NJ: Prentice-Hall, 27 July 2000. ISBN: 0130165832.</p> <p>All other readings will be in a 15.010/15.011 course reader. Part of the work requirement for this course will involve a careful study of these readings. Students will be expected to have read the required material <strong>before class</strong>. Doing so will make the lectures much more profitable.</p> <p>In addition to these readings, you should keep informed about current economic issues by reading the <em>Wall Street Journal</em> or the Business section of the <em>New York Times</em> on a regular basis. A magazine such as <em>Business Week</em> or <em>The Economist</em> is also useful for this purpose.</p> <h3 class=\"subsubhead\">Homework Assignments and Exams</h3> <p>We will assign six homework sets in this course. We assume that you will work on the problems as the material is covered in the lectures, <strong>not</strong> leaving the whole set to be done on the day before it is due. Make sure you try <strong>all</strong> of the homework problems yourself and understand the solutions in detail -- the midterm and final exams will contain problems very similar to homework problems.</p> <p>The midterm exam will be given in class six days after R5, and a three-hour comprehensive final exam will be given in L21.</p> <h3 class=\"subsubhead\">Grading</h3> <p>Typically, grading will be based on the exams, homework, and classroom participation according to the following weightings:</p> <div class=\"maintabletemplate\"> <table class=\"tablewidth50\" summary=\"See table caption for summary.\"> <caption class=\"invisible\">Table for Gradings</caption> <thead align=\"left\"> <tr class=\"tableheader\"> <th id=\"col1\" scope=\"col\" abbr=\"Week Number\">activities</th> <th id=\"col2\" scope=\"col\">percentages</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody align=\"left\"> <tr class=\"row\"> <td headers=\"col1\">Midterm Exam</td> <td headers=\"col2\">25%</td> </tr> <tr class=\"alt-row\"> <td headers=\"col1\">Final Exam</td> <td headers=\"col2\">50%</td> </tr> <tr class=\"row\"> <td headers=\"col1\">Homework Sets</td> <td headers=\"col2\">10%</td> </tr> <tr class=\"alt-row\"> <td headers=\"col1\">Classroom Participation</td> <td headers=\"col2\">15%</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> </div> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Policy on Homework Sets and Examinations</h2> <ul> <li>Homework sets are designed to help you learn how to apply the material presented in lectures and recitations. You are encouraged to discuss course material, including homework, with other students in the class. While homework will be graded for feedback purposes, the grade will not count towards your final grade. With respect to your final grade, you will get full credit as long as <strong>(but only if)</strong> you turn in your homework on time. The purpose of this policy is to ensure that homework is a risk-free learning opportunity, but also to signal our very strong belief that doing the homework is really an essential part of the learning experience for this class.<br /> <br /> </li> <li>Handwritten solutions are fine, as long as they are legible and neat. Please remember: if we can't read it, we can't grade it.<br /> <br /> </li> <li>In fairness to students who complete assignments on time, <strong>late homework sets will not be accepted</strong>. You may turn in assignments during the lecture on the day they are due. In addition, assignments may be placed in designated boxes. These boxes will be emptied at <strong>4:30 p.m.</strong> and their contents placed in sealed envelopes for delivery to the TA's. <strong>Please note that assignments left anywhere other than the boxes may be discarded.<br /> <br /> </strong></li> <li><strong>Examinations:</strong> During exams, you may consult the proctor administering the exam if you need clarification of exam questions. No discussion or other form of communication with anyone else will be permitted after the exams have been handed out, until all students have turned in their exam books. Students found to have cheated or engaged in any other unethical behavior will be given a grade of F on the examinations involved, and will be turned over to the appropriate disciplinary committees within MIT for further action. Students in the 8:30 section should not discuss an exam until after students in the 10:20 section have completed the exam. Students may not take an exam in another section and students arriving late will not be given extra time.<br /> <br /> </li> <li><strong>Calculators in Examinations:</strong> <strong>The only calculators permitted in exams are those with basic mathematical functions</strong>. Calculators that are capable of handling text etc. (such as the Hewlett-Packard Palmtop) may <strong>not</strong> be used in exams.<br /> <br /> </li> <li><strong>Regrade Policy:</strong> Requests for regrading an exam must be made within <strong>one week</strong> of the date upon which the graded examination is returned to the student. To request a regrade, attach a written explanation of the potential problem with the grading to the (entire) exam, and submit it to your TA. Regrading may not be limited to the part of the exam which is discussed in the written explanation. Regrades will be carried out by the 15.010 teaching faculty.</li> </ul> <p>If you have any questions about these policies, please raise them with one of the faculty or teaching assistants.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Student Conduct</h2> <p>Professional conduct is built upon the idea of mutual respect. Such conduct entails (but is not necessarily limited to):</p> <h3 class=\"subsubhead\">Attending the Class</h3> <p>Core classes are required for a reason, and each class benefits from the attendance and participation of all students. Your grade for participation will be affected by absences. You should sit in the appropriate seat, if relevant, and display a legible name card at all times.</p> <h3 class=\"subsubhead\">Arriving on Time</h3> <p>Late arrivals are disruptive to both lectures and class discussion, and show disrespect to those who are on time. Class starts at 8:35 or 10:25 depending on your section.</p> <h3 class=\"subsubhead\">Minimizing Disruptions</h3> <p>All cell phones, laptop computers, hand-held devices, and pagers should be turned off during class. You should not leave and re-enter the class. You should avoid engaging in side conversations after class has begun.</p> <h3 class=\"subsubhead\">Being Prepared for Class</h3> <p>You should be ready to discuss any assigned readings and to answer any assigned questions for each day's class, including being ready to open a case assigned for that day.</p> <h3 class=\"subsubhead\">Respect</h3> <p>You should act respectfully toward all class participants.</p> <p>Class participation grading reflects student adherence to these principles; students gain credit for contributing valuable insights and students lose credit if they fail to adhere to any of the above guidelines.</p> <div class=\"help slide-bottom\"> <div class=\"help-message\"> <a class=\"help-engage\" href=\"javascript: trackEvents('Bottom Get Started','bottom get started Click','Help Overlay');\">Need help getting started?</a> <a href=\"javascript:disableHelpPopup(); trackEvents('Bottom Don\\'t Show','bottom don\\'t show Click','Help Overlay');\" class=\"help-dismiss\">Don't show me this again</a> </div> </div> <div class=\"help popup-center\"> <div class=\"help-message\"> <p class=\"help-dismiss\"><a href=\"javascript:disableHelpPopup(); trackEvents('Popup Don\\'t Show','popup don\\'t show Click','Help Overlay');\">Don't show me this again</a></p> <h2>Welcome!</h2> <p>This is one of over 2,200 courses on OCW.

The fact of scarcity necessitates that individuals, firms, and societies choose among alternative uses â or allocations â of its limited resources. At the same time, the various choices made by different economic agents must be mutually consistent. For example, the expansion of one sector accompanied by that sector's increased use of labor and capital is only possible if accompanied by a net contraction in other industries. Markets are a mechanism to achieve such reconciliation. In this first part of the class we seek to understand how economists model the choice process of individual consumers and firms, and how markets work to coordinate these choices. We also examine how well markets perform this function using the economist's criterion of market efficiency.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Reading Assignments</h2> <p>The reading is primarily from: <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0321226577/ref=nosim/mitopencourse-20\"><img alt=\"Buy at Amazon\" src=\"/images/a_logo_17.gif\" align=\"absmiddle\" border=\"0\" /></a> Parkin, Michael. <em>Microeconomics.</em> 6th ed.

The choices we make affect others, and their choices impact us. Such situations are known as &quot;games&quot; and game-playing, while sounding whimsical, is serious business. Managers frequently play &quot;games&quot; both within the firm with other divisions and subordinates, etc. as well as outside the firm with competitors, customers, regulators, and even capital markets! The goal of this course is to enhance your ability to think strategically in complex, interactive environments. Knowledge of game theory will give you an advantage in such strategic settings.</p> <p>The course is structured around three &quot;themes for acquiring advantage in games&quot;:</p> <ol> <li><strong>Commitment / Strategic Moves:</strong> Credibility, threats, and promises as ways to change the game being played.<br /> <br /> </li> <li><strong>Exploiting Hidden Information:</strong> When to reveal information or not, including when to surprise an opponent. Adverse selection as a strategic force.<br /> <br /> </li> <li><strong>Limited Rationality:</strong> How to play when others may not be fully rational, and when others are uncertain about <strong>your</strong> rationality.<br /> </li> </ol> <p>Specific issues that arise in business strategy will act as motivation, but this is not a course about <strong>business tactics</strong>. For instance, you will not necessarily become a better trader or a better negotiator. Rather the goal is to provide you with a deeper understanding of key issues that arise in a wide variety of strategic situations.</p> <p>As a core discipline of economics, game theory is applied in many other courses offered at Sloan. These applications are wide-ranging: games played between competing firms in 15.013 (Industrial Economics for Strategic Decisions); games played between firms and their suppliers and between managers and their employees in 15.903 (Corporate Strategy and Extended Enterprises); not to mention applications in negotiations, international macroeconomics, corporate finance, etcâ¦ A half-semester could never suffice to study even a fraction of these particular applications in any depth. Rather this course is designed to provide students with deeper intuitions and a framework for thinking about interactive strategic settings. While the course is designed to complement Sloan's other economics and strategy offerings, it is self-contained. There are no prerequisites beyond the Core economics course 15.010.</p> <p>My view is that the important ideas of game theory are best mastered not at the level of some abstract theory but through the flesh and blood of real examples. For this reason, we will discuss numerous real-world examples and analyze games that arise in business settings. Indeed, an important element of the course is a team project in which students will identify a real-world game of interest, analyze it using the tools of the course, and offer concrete strategic advice to some player in the game.</p> <p>In the same spirit, my goal is to teach game theory, not mathematics. Actually, students will discover a fascinating paradox: the more transparent the mathematics, the <strong>more</strong> interesting and challenging the issues that can arise. For example, in 15.010 we spent our time methodically calculating equilibrium in the Cournot oligopoly game by deriving reaction curves and so on, but there was nothing truly interesting at the superficial â though mathematical â level of that treatment. We will of course use reaction curves and such as tools but only ultimately to get to ideas that are mathematics-free. So when someone asks you a simple question without all of the equations and curves (say &quot;Should we pursue a cost-reducing innovation that will ultimately lower both our costs and our competitors?&quot;) you will have a ready understanding of the key strategic issues involved.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Readings</h2> <p>The text for this course is:</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0393974219/ref=nosim/mitopencourse-20\"><img alt=\"Buy at Amazon\" src=\"/images/a_logo_17.gif\" align=\"absmiddle\" border=\"0\" /></a> Dixit, Avinash K., and Susan Skeath. <em>Games of Strategy</em>.

As has been the case for many previous versions of this seminar, we often choose a topic that is of current interest (perhaps even &quot;hot&quot;) in the optimization community, or that is topical in practice. Randomized methods for deterministic optimization certainly meets the first criterion (if not the second as well).</p> <p>In contrast to conventional optimization algorithms whose iterates are computed and analyzed deterministically, randomized methods rely on stochastic processes and random number/vector generation as part of the algorithm and/or its analysis. Consider the simplex method, for example. One can develop a randomized version of the simplex method by choosing incoming columns or entire bases according to some stochastic process. For more general nonlinear optimization problems, a simple randomized algorithm would be to base the search direction on a randomly chosen vector; the distribution of the vector might be iteration-dependent, of course. There are very sophisticated randomized algorithms for convex and non-convex optimization that rely on recently-developed methods for approximately generating uniformly distributed random variables on convex sets. In terms of complexity analysis, many randomized algorithms have excellent properties: they solve problems to a high accuracy in polynomial time with high probability or their expected running time is polynomial. Of course, these sorts of statements are vague until we define &quot;high probability&quot;, etc. In the seminar, we will study some very recent papers on this topic, many by MIT faculty, as well as some older papers from the existing literature that are only now receiving attention.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Seminar Format</h2> <p>The seminar will meet once a week for two hours. In each session, one or more students or a faculty member will have the responsibility to lead the discussion. Typically, each session will cover one or two papers from the literature (published or working papers). Student discussion leaders have responsibility for preparing a conference quality presentation (with overheads) and for preparing a handout of transparencies for the class. Therefore, the seminar also provides a friendly setting for developing presentation skills and practicing teaching. The seminar is intended to be an informal forum for discussion and for interaction among the student and faculty participants, and works best when everyone contributes. (Indeed, in the past the seminar has been most successful when it is &quot;alive&quot; and several individuals are adding to the discussion leader's presentation by suggesting material on the board.) Since we are collectively exploring an advanced topic, the discussion leader need not feel that he or she must have a complete grasp of everything being presented â often coming to class with questions about a technical point leads to the most lively discussion and the greatest learning.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Grades</h2> <p>Since this is an advanced seminar, grading and distinguishing between student performance is not very important (at least to me). Students who make an honest effort to make good presentations and to contribute to the best of their ability will receive a good grade (an A).</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Session Coverage</h2> <p>Since this is an informal seminar, we do not typically keep to any fixed schedule. If we find that we need more time for a paper once we are discussing it, then we will typically extend the discussion to the next session and delay subsequent sessions. Or, if someone discovers some new material that we might like to discuss, then we might add that to the agenda.

Foreign direct investment (FDI), portfolio investments and outsourcing businesses have increased dramatically in these two economies.</p> <p>Despite the rising importance of these two economies on the world stage, our knowledge and analysis of these two countries in an integrated manner has remained poor. On the one hand, analysts in the business community tend to lump the two countries together as a part of a homogenous group known as &quot;emerging markets&quot;. This is so despite the substantial differences in their political systems, reform policies and business organizations. Academics have tended to treat the two countries separately, preferring to specialize in issues and questions specific to one or the other country.</p> <p>This is an <strong>experimental</strong> course, and its purpose is to bring these two countries together in an attempt to come up with a coherent framework which we can use to analyze these two countries. It should be acknowledged explicitly and upfront that there is a lot we do not know in terms of how to do this. It is heavily incumbent on the students in the course to provide perspectives, facts and viewpoints that will contribute to this effort. The course is designed to facilitate this effort. Our learning model is inductive, rather than deductive, and it is heavily based on class discussions and participation. The group projects should aim at integrating analysis, knowledge and understanding of these two countries.</p> <p>We start with &quot;macro&quot; perspectives on these two countries and then move to industry/firm-level analyses. The idea is to analyze the decisions and performance of firms in the greater political and economic contexts in which they operate. This is the emphasis of this course, i.e., we study the interface between firms and their business environments rather than assuming that business decisions are only driven by dynamics internal in a firm.</p> <p>We grapple with three broad questions in this course. (1) What are the essential features of the political and economic contexts for businesses in these two countries? (2) How have these contextual features shaped the performance and competitiveness of firms in them? (3) If one were to draw up a balance sheet of these two economies, what would it look like? In between, we have many specific questions and issues to address, such as the role of FDI in economic development, the growth and development of entrepreneurship, and the effect of globalization on local firms.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Requirements</h2> <p>The requirements for the course and the contribution of each towards the final grade are as follows:</p> <div class=\"maintabletemplate\"><table summary=\"See table caption for summary.\" class=\"tablewidth50\"> <caption class=\"invisible\">Grading criteria.</caption> <thead align=\"left\"> <tr> <th scope=\"col\">ACTIVITIES</th> <th scope=\"col\">PERCENTAGES</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody align=\"left\"> <tr class=\"row\"> <td>Two case write-up assignments (10% each)</td> <td>20%</td> </tr> <tr class=\"alt-row\"> <td>Group research paper</td> <td>40%</td> </tr> <tr class=\"row\"> <td>Class participation</td> <td>40%</td> </tr> </tbody> </table></div> <p> </p><h3 class=\"subsubhead\">Class Participation</h3> <p>Your active participation in the discussion in class is integral to the design of this course. Prior preparation of the cases and assigned readings under required readings are essential as your familiarity with the required readings is presumed in the lectures and case discussions. It should be noted and stressed that a significant portion of your gradeâ40%âdepends on your class participation. Students should be prepared and accept to be &quot;cold-called,&quot; i.e., being called to participate without volunteering to participate.</p> <p>Only the required readings will be discussed in class.</p> <p>For each class, I have provided a number of discussion questions. These are suggested questions to help you think about the issues that may arise in the course of class discussions. They may not be mechanically followed during the class discussions. Because we value exchange of ideas as an effective way of learning, we encourage debates among students and expressions of your own views.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Calendar</h2> <div class=\"maintabletemplate\"><table summary=\"See table caption for summary.\" class=\"tablewidth75\"> <caption class=\"invisible\">Course calendar.</caption> <thead align=\"left\"> <tr> <th scope=\"col\">SES #</th> <th scope=\"col\">TOPICS</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody align=\"left\"> <tr class=\"row\"> <td colspan=\"2\"><strong>Part I: An overview</strong></td><td style=\"display: none;\" io-table-normalizer=\"\"><strong>Part I: An overview</strong></td> </tr> <tr class=\"alt-row\"> <td>1</td> <td>Introduction to the course</td> </tr> <tr class=\"row\"> <td>2</td> <td>The macro perspective: China and India</td> </tr> <tr class=\"alt-row\"> <td>3</td> <td>Financing environment</td> </tr> <tr class=\"row\"> <td>4</td> <td>Business environment</td> </tr> <tr class=\"alt-row\"> <td colspan=\"2\"><strong>Part II: Entrepreneurial dynamics</strong></td><td style=\"display: none;\" io-table-normalizer=\"\"><strong>Part II: Entrepreneurial dynamics</strong></td> </tr> <tr class=\"row\"> <td>5</td> <td>Legend (Lenovo)</td> </tr> <tr class=\"alt-row\"> <td>6</td> <td>Infosys</td> </tr> <tr class=\"row\"> <td>7</td> <td>Venture capital and private equity</td> </tr> <tr class=\"alt-row\"> <td>8</td> <td>Diaspora in China and India</td> </tr> <tr class=\"row\"> <td colspan=\"2\"><strong>Part III: Foreign direct investment (FDI) controversies</strong></td><td style=\"display: none;\" io-table-normalizer=\"\"><strong>Part III: Foreign direct investment (FDI) controversies</strong></td> </tr> <tr class=\"alt-row\"> <td>9</td> <td>FDI opening</td> </tr> <tr class=\"row\"> <td>10</td> <td>Intellectual property rights (IPR) and pharmaceutical industry in India</td> </tr> <tr class=\"alt-row\"> <td>11</td> <td>Multinational corporations (MNCs) and local competition</td> </tr> <tr class=\"row\"> <td>12</td> <td>Bottom of the pyramid dynamics in India</td> </tr> <tr class=\"alt-row\"> <td>13</td> <td>Debating development models</td> </tr> </tbody> </table></div> <div class=\"help slide-bottom\"> <div class=\"help-message\"> <a class=\"help-engage\" href=\"javascript: trackEvents('Bottom Get Started','bottom get started Click','Help Overlay');\">Need help getting started?</a> <a href=\"javascript:disableHelpPopup(); trackEvents('Bottom Don\\'t Show','bottom don\\'t show Click','Help Overlay');\" class=\"help-dismiss\">Don't show me this again</a> </div> </div> <div class=\"help popup-center\"> <div class=\"help-message\"> <p class=\"help-dismiss\"><a href=\"javascript:disableHelpPopup(); trackEvents('Popup Don\\'t Show','popup don\\'t show Click','Help Overlay');\">Don't show me this again</a></p> <h2>Welcome!</h2> <p>This is one of over 2,200 courses on OCW.

We will look at a range of successful practices and guidelines that have been derived from both research and experience, give you the opportunity to develop and practice your skills, and provide you with feedback to help you strengthen them. Typically, we will use a workshop format that relies heavily on discussion and in-class exercises. Because your regular attendance is critical to learning from these in-class activities, and since many exercises are designed around your team, unexcused absences in 15.280 will have a detrimental effect on your final course grade beyond the 20% class participation portion of the grade. Where possible, assignments in 15.280 build upon materials covered in the Organization Processes (15.311) team projects or in required Career Development Office activities, to help you hone your communication skills in the context of these activities. Additionally, there will be opportunities to develop and practice specific communication skills in 15.277, Special Seminar in Communication: Leadership and Personal Effectiveness Coaching. 15.280 is offered for 6 units and 15.277 provides an additional 3 units for a total of 9 units in Managerial Communication; you will receive the same grade for your accomplishments in 15.280 and 15.277.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Text and Materials</h2> <h3 class=\"subsubhead\">Required</h3> <p><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0131467042/ref=nosim/mitopencourse-20\"><img align=\"absMiddle\" border=\"0\" src=\"/images/a_logo_17.gif\" alt=\"Buy at Amazon\" /></a> Munter, Mary. <em>Guide to Managerial Communication</em>. 7th ed.

Please proofread and print out final versions for submission unless otherwise indicated. To guard against losses or recording errors, keep copies of the papers you turn in and retain all the graded assignments that are returned to you throughout the semester.</p> <p>All papers are expected to be handed in on time. Late assignments will be penalized. No assignments will be accepted more than one week after the due date.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Procedures for Oral Presentations</h2> <p>Most of your oral presentations will take place outside class time in lab sessions with a few other students and your professor or TA. You will sign up for a lab session for each of the two oral assignments. If you miss a scheduled oral presentation without advance consultation, you will receive a score of zero for that assignment.</p> <p>You must bring a mini DVD+RW disk to each of your presentations. We will record your presentations on a disk for you to view later on your computer. Based on viewing your disk, you will write a formal evaluation of your first presentation (see <a href=\"/courses/sloan-school-of-management/15-280-communication-for-managers-fall-2008/assignments\">assignments</a>), and a final self-assessment of your progress in written and oral communication at the end of the course.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Grading of Course Assignments</h2> <p>Assignments worth 10% or more of your grade will be graded on a 10-point scale, while homework (HW) assignments, each of which counts 5% of your grade, will be graded on a â-/â/â+ basis. The final grade will be assigned on the basis of a curve.</p> <p>The course assignments are weighted as follows:</p> <div class=\"maintabletemplate\"><table summary=\"See table caption for summary.\" class=\"tablewidth75\"> <caption class=\"invisible\">Grading criteria.</caption> <thead align=\"left\"> <tr> <th scope=\"col\">ACTIVITIES</th> <th scope=\"col\">PERCENTAGES</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody align=\"left\"> <tr class=\"row\"> <td>Baseline self-assessment (HW)</td> <td>5%</td> </tr> <tr class=\"alt-row\"> <td>Persuasive presentation with Q&amp;A</td> <td>10%</td> </tr> <tr class=\"row\"> <td>Self-evaluation of persuasive presentation</td> <td>10%</td> </tr> <tr class=\"alt-row\"> <td>Lincoln electric in China recommendation</td> <td>15%</td> </tr> <tr class=\"row\"> <td>Cover letter (HW)</td> <td>5%</td> </tr> <tr class=\"alt-row\"> <td>Interactive presentation</td> <td>15%</td> </tr> <tr class=\"row\"> <td>Group presentation: team project</td> <td>15%</td> </tr> <tr class=\"alt-row\"> <td>Final self-assessment (HW)</td> <td>5%</td> </tr> <tr class=\"row\"> <td>Class participation</td> <td>20%</td> </tr> </tbody> </table></div> <p> </p> <div class=\"help slide-bottom\"> <div class=\"help-message\"> <a class=\"help-engage\" href=\"javascript: trackEvents('Bottom Get Started','bottom get started Click','Help Overlay');\">Need help getting started?</a> <a href=\"javascript:disableHelpPopup(); trackEvents('Bottom Don\\'t Show','bottom don\\'t show Click','Help Overlay');\" class=\"help-dismiss\">Don't show me this again</a> </div> </div> <div class=\"help popup-center\"> <div class=\"help-message\"> <p class=\"help-dismiss\"><a href=\"javascript:disableHelpPopup(); trackEvents('Popup Don\\'t Show','popup don\\'t show Click','Help Overlay');\">Don't show me this again</a></p> <h2>Welcome!</h2> <p>This is one of over 2,200 courses on OCW.

The goals of this class are to provide opportunities for you to continue polishing your communication skills in different contexts, and particularly to provide practice in and feedback on the interactive communication skills essential to successful managers.</p> <p>You will give various types of presentations, including impromptu presentations and a longer (15 minute) presentation. In addition, we will practice interactive communication (e.g., role play with hostile client, interactive presentation to a hostile audience) and communication in groups (e.g., running meetings, participating in group decision making). Writing assignments include self-analysis (including two individual self-analysis and one team self-analysis of your team project) and one short business document (see discussion of individual project, below).</p> <p>The course will be highly participative, with most class time being spent in hands-on communication exercises.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Team Project: Team-Led Class and Team Self-Analysis</h2> <p>The class sessions designated &quot;Team-led class&quot; in the calendar will focus on communication topics chosen by teams of students and will be organized by members of the teams. Early in the term the class will divide up into teams. Each team will be responsible for one class session. Your team will choose a topic, distribute readings (if appropriate), and plan classroom activities. Such activities could include role plays, discussion, presentations, cases, or outside visitors (if feasible). Some of the topics your team might choose include business-media relations, negotiation and conflict resolution, electronic communication, corporate crisis communication, intercultural communication, and gender issues in communication. After its class session, each team will submit a 2-3 page analysis of the team's <strong>process</strong> and its <strong>product</strong> (the class itself).</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Individual Project: Presentation and Executive Summary</h2> <p>The individual project for the course culminates in a 15-minute presentation and an accompanying one-page executive summary. You may choose your topic in conjunction with a project for another class, a job-related task, or your thesis. If possible, it should be a project involving an external organization so that your real audience will be non-academic. Whether or not your project has a true external audience, however, you will assume a &quot;real-world&quot; audience for both the presentation and the document. Your oral presentation and written document should serve a real need for your assumed audience.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Grading</h2> <p>Missing more than two classes will count against your participation grade. Assignments in the course will be weighted as follows:</p> <p> </p><div class=\"maintabletemplate\"><table class=\"tablewidth3\" summary=\"See table caption for summary.\"> <caption class=\"invisible\">Grading criteria.</caption> <thead align=\"left\"> <tr> <th scope=\"col\">ACTIVITIES</th> <th scope=\"col\">PERCENTAGES</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody align=\"left\"> <tr class=\"gray-row\"> <td>5-minute persuasive presentation with Q and A</td> <td>5%</td> </tr> <tr class=\"white-row\"> <td>10-minute presentation to hostile audience with self-analysis</td> <td>15%</td> </tr> <tr class=\"gray-row\"> <td>Analysis of leadership characteristics and behaviors</td> <td>10%</td> </tr> <tr class=\"white-row\"> <td>Team project and analysis (team grade)</td> <td>25%</td> </tr> <tr class=\"gray-row\"> <td>Individual project, presentation and summary</td> <td>25%</td> </tr> <tr class=\"white-row\"> <td>Class participation in role plays, impromptus, and other in-class activities</td> <td>20%</td> </tr> </tbody> </table></div> <p> </p><h2 class=\"subhead\">Calendar</h2> <div class=\"maintabletemplate\"><table class=\"tablewidth75\" summary=\"See table caption for summary.\"> <caption class=\"invisible\">Course calendar.</caption> <thead align=\"left\"> <tr> <th scope=\"col\">LEC #</th> <th scope=\"col\">TOPICS</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody align=\"left\"> <tr class=\"gray-row\"> <td>1</td> <td>Introduction to the course, and to interactive communication.

First, the course will acquaint you with guidelines that will help you create well-crafted academic communication. Second, it will give you the opportunity to practice your communication skills and to receive extensive feedback from your colleagues and from me. You will write and/or revise an article manuscript or conference paper, present a conference paper or job talk, write a manuscript peer review, and engage in various other communication exercises. The article and talk, which are the major assignments of the course, will be based on material from your own doctoral studies. Third, the course will provide an opportunity for you to learn about professional norms for a range of activities that surround the academic enterprise, including, for example, the scholarly publication process and the job search process. </p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Who Should Take this Course?</h2> <p>This course is for doctoral students in management or related fields. It is best suited to students who have started on their own research, generally in their 2nd year or beyond, and who are beginning to think about the job market. If you are a first year graduate student and would like to take this course, please schedule time to talk to me about whether the course is appropriate for you.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Grading</h2> <p>There are four graded requirements in this course, weighted as follows:</p> <div class=\"maintabletemplate\"> <table class=\"tablewidth50\" summary=\"See table caption for summary.\"> <caption class=\"invisible\">Grading criteria.</caption> <thead align=\"left\"> <tr> <th>Activities</th> <th>Percentages</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody align=\"left\"> <tr class=\"row\"> <td>Written assignment with feedback and revision (conference paper, journal article, or grant proposal)</td> <td>30%</td> </tr> <tr class=\"alt-row\"> <td>Oral presentation with option to re-do (conference presentation or job talk)</td> <td>30%</td> </tr> <tr class=\"row\"> <td>Manuscript Review (for conference or journal)</td> <td>15%</td> </tr> <tr class=\"alt-row\"> <td>Class Participation (including other assigned exercises)</td> <td>25%</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> </div> <p>We will discuss and in some cases do exercises (included in your class participation grade) around giving &quot;elevator pitches&quot; about your research, conducting a job search, teaching, and interviewing for field work.</p> <ul> <li>Written and Oral Assignments: Your own research should serve as the basis for the first two assignments. In fact, if you are currently preparing a journal article, conference paper, grant proposal, and/or job talk, you may use that work to fulfill assignments in this class.</li> <li>Manuscript Review: One of the tasks faced by most academics is reviewing manuscripts written by others for submission to a conference or journal. Learning how to write a constructive review is a key academic skill that we will discuss and that you will get an opportunity to practice. You will arrange with your advisor or another faculty member in your field to review a paper in your field.</li> <li>Class Participation: Class attendance and participation are important because you will be giving each other feedback on your work, as well as doing short exercises in some classes. Please make every effort to attend all classes.</li> </ul> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Practicing Skills, Receiving Feedback</h2> <p>As you will see from the attached class outline, we will discuss several types or genres of academic communication during the course, from journal articles to job talks. Much of the class time, however, will be devoted to giving you an opportunity to practice those genres and to give and receive feedback. Each member of the class is expected to provide critical feedback on the work submitted by his/her classmates.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Texts</h2> <p>You will need the following books for the course: </p> <ul> <li>Cummings, L. L. and Peter Frost. Publishing in the Organizational Sciences. Sage Publications, 1995. 2nd Edition.

Bureaucracy was best. It seemed that only the details remained to be worked out: what was the ideal mix of salary and commission; how many employees should there be for each manager; how bright should the lights be in the workplace, and so on.</p> <p>This smug complacency was shattered thirty years ago by a series of studies showing that there is, in fact, no one best way to organize. Different environments place differing requirements on organizations. An organization designed to thrive in a stable, well-understood environment, for example, cannot be expected to do as well in conditions of uncertainty and rapid change. A theory of relativity for organizational behavior was needed, and <em>contingency theory</em> was born. Scholars began to search for the two or three key elements of the environment that determined which type of organization was most appropriate in a given setting.</p> <p>In the next two decades, they found not two or three but two or three <em>thousand</em> such contingencies. It has become increasingly clear that the best way to organize in a particular situation depends on so many factors â elements of strategy, industry, market, history, culture, people, technology â that we will never find a recipe for the ideal organization and there will never be a grand unified theory of organizational behavior. It is now clear that building and sustaining quality organizations will always require the analytical skills, judgment, intuition, and especially the creativity of human leaders and managers.</p> <p>This course is designed to help you develop these skills, build your understanding of how organizations behave and change, and enhance your capacity to act in organizations. Some materials closely linked to this course have been introduced (albeit swiftly) in the Sloan Orientation and have emphasized interpersonal relations and team processes. Much of the material in Communications class (<a href=\"/courses/sloan-school-of-management/15-280-communication-for-managers-fall-2008/index.htm\">15.280</a>) will also be quite relevant to what we study in this course. This class, however, will focus on larger scale levels of analysis: organizational structure and design, power and politics, culture and change.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Course Summary</h2> <p>The ability to act with skill and creativity in organizations begins with the development of multiple perspectives on organizations. As you are no doubt aware, humans habitually settle into fixed perspectives, unchallenged mental models of how the world works, unconscious filters of what we pay attention to and what we ignore. These habits offer powerful economies of thought: without them, the simplest task of picking a face out in a crowd or listening to the radio while driving would be impossible. But they impose costs as well. They lock us into a single view of the world that may not be best, that is surely incomplete, that will become outdated, and that is resistant to change. Creativity involves trading off economy of thought for innovation of thought. It requires the discipline of interpreting what we see and hear in organizations from multiple standpoints.</p> <p>As a starting point, this course is organized around three different perspectives on organizations: the <em>strategic design</em> perspective, the <em>political</em> perspective, and the <em>cultural</em> perspective. Each of them offers a different angle on what an organization is, and each offers different tools for action.</p> <p>Accordingly, we will probe some of the social and psychological processes that make it likely that managers will fall into unchallenged patterns of action and thought. We will then turn to a more in-depth treatment of the strategic design, and political and cultural perspectives on organization. While leading and managing others always presents challenges, our goal in this course is to use the three perspectives to develop a more complete understanding of these challenges, so as to enable organizational participants to best address these challenges. In order to make the material tangible, we require that students go out into the world and study a real organization as a &quot;live&quot; case study. Thus, a major requirement for this course is a team project study of an organization that is attempting a change initiative (more on this later).</p> <p>As this syllabus displays, the course combines conceptual and experiential approaches. It involves exercises, case studies, lectures, videos, and group work.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Coursework and Grading</h2> <p><em>Preparation</em></p> <p>The expectations of you are relatively simple: arrive punctually to class, be well prepared, and participate actively. There are several ways in which the materials in this course help you to do this:</p> <ul> <li><a href=\"/courses/sloan-school-of-management/15-311-organizational-processes-fall-2003/calendar\">Short Introductions</a>: These have been provided for each session in the course outline to give you some background on the materials to be covered. You should read these first.<br /> </li> <li><a href=\"/courses/sloan-school-of-management/15-311-organizational-processes-fall-2003/readings\">Study Questions</a>: These are there to guide you through the case material, helping you to focus on what's important.<br /> </li> <li><a href=\"/courses/sloan-school-of-management/15-311-organizational-processes-fall-2003/readings\">Readings</a>: Most sessions have accompanying readings, which you are expected to complete. All class assignments and readings are in the 15.311 course packet available at the campus copy center.<br /> </li> </ul> <p><em>Participation (30%)</em></p> <p>The character of the course naturally lends itself to active exchange among participants. Participation is encouraged and recognized in several ways. Your grade for participation in the course will be affected by absences. If you must miss a class, please let your instructor know beforehand. To recognize those whose comments and questions benefit us all, a part of the participation grade is based on contributions made in class. Both quantity and quality are relevant and although consistent contribution is ideal, a few points of genuine insight may go a long way. The point of participation is that sharing perceptions and ideas with others is crucial for learning and for understanding how the diverse opinions that you are likely to encounter in an organization are articulated and debated. You will find yourself presenting and testing new ideas that are not wholly formulated and assisting others to shape their ideas as well. You should be prepared to take some risks and be supportive of the efforts of others.</p> <p><em>Team Project (50%)</em></p> <p>Your team will work together on several assignments and exercises in 15.311. The most significant of these is that each team is required to produce a team project for the semester. This project will involve students going into the field and studying an organizational change initiative.</p> <p>For details about the team project, see the <a href=\"/courses/sloan-school-of-management/15-311-organizational-processes-fall-2003/projects\">projects</a> page.</p> <p><em>Individual Case Write-Up (20%)</em></p> <p>Students will be required to write a 3-5 page analysis of a short case study. This will be an <em>individual</em> task and will require the strategic design, political and cultural analysis of an organizational change effort as well as a brief integrative action plan to remedy efforts that may have gone astray. The case will be distributed in Session 10 (October 30), and is due in Session 12 (November 6).</p> <p><em>Grading Summary</em></p> <div class=\"maintabletemplate\"> <table class=\"tablewidth75\" summary=\"See table caption for summary.\"> <caption class=\"invisible\">Grading information.</caption> <thead align=\"left\"> <tr> <th id=\"col1\" scope=\"col\">ACTIVITY</th> <th id=\"col2\" scope=\"col\">PERCENT</th> <th id=\"col3\" scope=\"col\">KEY DATES</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody align=\"left\"> <tr class=\"gray-row\"> <td headers=\"col1\">Participation</td> <td headers=\"col2\">30%</td> <td headers=\"col3\"></td> </tr> <tr class=\"white-row\"> <td headers=\"col1\">Team Paper</td> <td headers=\"col2\">50%</td> <td headers=\"col3\">Due in 15.280 Session 12 (December 9)</td> </tr> <tr class=\"gray-row\"> <td headers=\"col1\">Case Write-Up</td> <td headers=\"col2\">20%</td> <td headers=\"col3\">Given out Session 10 (October 30), Due Session 12 (December 6)</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> </div> <br /> <p><em>Special Sessions</em></p> <p>We have designed this course to work in conjunction with 15.280 Communications (see the <a href=\"/courses/sloan-school-of-management/15-311-organizational-processes-fall-2003/calendar\">schedule</a>). Thus, the classes will share certain assignments. Some of our required sessions will be offered jointly with the Career Development Office (in particular, Sessions 11 and 15 on Oct. 31 and Nov. 21). In addition, Prof. Roberto Fernandez and the Career Development Office will be offering an optional session on Hiring on Sept. 12.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Faculty</h2> <p>This class is being taught jointly by four faculty from the Organizational Studies Group. Classroom teachers will be Prof. Paul Carlile (Cohort E), Prof. Roberto Fernandez (Cohorts A, C and F), and Prof. John Van Maanen (Cohorts B and D). In addition, Prof. John Carroll will help guide many of the team projects. (Precise assignments of teams to faculty members will be announced on Team Day, Sept. 26).</p> <div class=\"help slide-bottom\"> <div class=\"help-message\"> <a class=\"help-engage\" href=\"javascript: trackEvents('Bottom Get Started','bottom get started Click','Help Overlay');\">Need help getting started?</a> <a href=\"javascript:disableHelpPopup(); trackEvents('Bottom Don\\'t Show','bottom don\\'t show Click','Help Overlay');\" class=\"help-dismiss\">Don't show me this again</a> </div> </div> <div class=\"help popup-center\"> <div class=\"help-message\"> <p class=\"help-dismiss\"><a href=\"javascript:disableHelpPopup(); trackEvents('Popup Don\\'t Show','popup don\\'t show Click','Help Overlay');\">Don't show me this again</a></p> <h2>Welcome!</h2> <p>This is one of over 2,200 courses on OCW.

Other courses and workshops over the next two years will emphasize specific leadership skills such as communication, motivation, decision making, and management of planned change. In this orientation we explore the images, the thoughts, and the experiences that make up the life of a leader... in other words, the &quot;Universe Within.&quot; As part of Universe Within, we engage in a day-long Outward Bound exercise to gain first-hand practice in team building.</p> <p>The goals of Universe Within are ambitious:</p> <ul> <li> To explore the limits of our ideas, our abilities, and our visions of the future</li> <li> To establish a learning organization of our own - one that will evolve over the course of the next two years and beyond</li> <li> To challenge conventional ideas about what it means to be a leader, a follower, a student, and a teacher</li> </ul> <p>The schedule of sessions (below) depicts the major areas of leadership we hope to cover. The brief description of each session should not be confused with a &quot;lesson plan.&quot; Instead, we have attempted to identify an attribute of leadership or a problem for leaders that can serve as a centerpiece for dialogue. In most sessions, we will combine practice with theory.</p> <p>Throughout Universe Within, we build from research on leadership in the behavioral sciences. However, we are also mindful that leadership of the 21st century manufacturing enterprise may require skills that differ in important ways from those that sufficed in the 1920s, 60s, or 90s.</p> <p>Universe Within is without parallel in any major graduate degree program in the United States. Each time we undertake it, we feel like it is an experiment. Like most experimental situations, we cannot anticipate the exact trajectory our discussions will take. Neither can we predict whether each session will achieve the goals we have attached to it. Perhaps most importantly, we cannot predict whether all participants will find the effort equally useful. Thus, we will check periodically to see whether we are satisfied with our progress.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Leadership Development</h2> <p>&quot;Management is about coping with complexity... Leadership is about coping with change.&quot; (John Kotter, <em>Harvard Business Review</em>, 1990).</p> <p>In an era of high velocity change - in markets, technologies, politics and demographics - leaders who can cope with change are essential to enterprise success. Leadership is a theme that runs throughout the Leaders For Manufacturing program, beginning with the Universe Within and continuing through workshops, courses, internship, and beyond. Our purpose is to develop leaders who can flourish in an environment of turbulence and change.</p> <p>The leadership concepts in the LFM program are derived from an analysis of major trends in business and the global economy, new developments in organization theory and management practice, and the foundational social science disciplines of sociology, psychology, and economics that help us understand the dynamics of human interaction. We also draw upon our years of experience of active collaboration on the topic of leadership development involving industry and academia in the LFM program.</p> <p>At the beginning of the Universe Within, we introduce the Sloan Leadership Model, a dynamic approach to Leadership designed from the viewpoint of a newcomer to a team or organization who wishes to bring change. The newcomer may be an appointed leader with formal authority or a team member who rises to the occasion. This is a particularly appropriate starting point for thinking about entry into the LFM community, beginning new summer teams, and later for embarking on internships and new jobs. The LFM program also introduces other useful and complementary leadership concepts in later courses.</p> <p>The LFM leadership development activities offer a multi-dimensional approach to leadership. They provide tangible skills as well as pathways to longer-term individual, team, and organizational learning. Each component of the program is structured around three key activities:</p> <h3 class=\"subsubhead\">Skill Development</h3> <p>Systematic instruction in the techniques and behaviors associated with effective leadership.</p> <h3 class=\"subsubhead\">Practice</h3> <p>Opportunities to exercise those techniques and behaviors and to get feedback on individual performance in order to identify areas for improvement.</p> <h3 class=\"subsubhead\">Reflection on Practice</h3> <p>A discipline that encourages continuous improvement of individual and group skills and practice.</p> <div class=\"help slide-bottom\"> <div class=\"help-message\"> <a class=\"help-engage\" href=\"javascript: trackEvents('Bottom Get Started','bottom get started Click','Help Overlay');\">Need help getting started?</a> <a href=\"javascript:disableHelpPopup(); trackEvents('Bottom Don\\'t Show','bottom don\\'t show Click','Help Overlay');\" class=\"help-dismiss\">Don't show me this again</a> </div> </div> <div class=\"help popup-center\"> <div class=\"help-message\"> <p class=\"help-dismiss\"><a href=\"javascript:disableHelpPopup(); trackEvents('Popup Don\\'t Show','popup don\\'t show Click','Help Overlay');\">Don't show me this again</a></p> <h2>Welcome!</h2> <p>This is one of over 2,200 courses on OCW.

To deal with these changes requires new skills and attitudes on the part of managers. The goal of the Leading Organizations course is to make you aware of this challenge and equip you to better meet it. In short, the purpose is to acquaint you with some of psychological and sociological phenomena that regularly occur in organizations â the less visible forces that influence employee and managerial behavior.</p> <p>The aim is to increase your understanding of these forces â in yourself and in others â so that as they become more visible, they become manageable (more or less) and hence subject to analysis and choice. We will look at these issues from individual, group and organizational points of view and organize our treatment of managerial thought and action from several analytic perspectives - namely, the strategic design, political and cultural perspectives.</p> <p>The subject is taught in a multi-method fashion. There will be lectures and readings. There will be learning group meetings with observers and observer feedback (a process initiated in Lotte Bailyn's 15.321 summer course). There will be four short papers that will allow you to collect and analyze your reflections and observations. These papers will be collected in class on the date due.</p> <p>There will not be any examinations or letter grades (although it is possible to get a D or F). But there will be lots of feedback on the papers and in the learning groups. I expect all of you to do the readings and assignments in spite of the fact that I will not test you on them through the traditional methods. You will only get as much out of this subject as you invest in it. Much of the learning is what you can teach each other, so it will be up to everyone to attend all sessions and get fully involved.</p> <p>Students receive only one grade for 15.321, Leading Organizations I, and this course.</p> <p>Onward.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Readings</h2> <p><em>Books</em></p> <p>Schein, Edgar H. <em>Career Anchors: Discovering Your Real Values</em>.

                    "syllabus": "<div id=\"course_inner_section\"> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Course Meeting Times</h2> <p>No regular class schedule; students meet in teams.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Background</h2> <p>Teamwork is a critical business competency, regardless of industry or organization. Start-up companies are basically small teams of highly motivated people, often with little prior business experience. Team skills are essential to coordinate individuals and adapt the organization to the unpredictable demands of the new economy. Even huge established companies are restructuring into teams around projects, product lines, customers, new kinds of partnerships, etc. New technologies and competitive pressures are breaking up hierarchies; lower levels of the organization have more responsibility, act more flexibly. Command-and-control has given way to network-and-negotiate. </p> <p>For all the above reasons and many more, the Sloan Master's Core contains significant team experiences. We know from practical experience that teams are meaningful only if there is something riding on the team performance, such as a common goal with real consequences. In the Team Project, which is part of the Organizational Processes course (15.311), everyone on the team matters, every relationship influences the team performance, and every conflict is a potential learning opportunity. &quot;In the modern organization we manage as if everyone is a volunteer.&quot; You have to learn to work together, to maintain purpose and commitment, and to develop as team members and leaders.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Goals</h2> <p>The Team Project has the goals of (1. developing teamwork and leadership skills and (2. learning from the analysis of a change initiative in a real-world company using concepts from <em>Organizational Processes</em> (OP) and other core courses. </p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Structure</h2> <p>The Team Project has no regular class schedule or weekly readings. Almost everything is oriented around your team and your project, with only a few deadlines. You design your own structure for accomplishing the task and meeting your personal and team goals. <strong>Each team is responsible for analyzing a recent, ongoing, or anticipated initiative at a real company</strong>. Examples might be a strategic reorientation, organizational restructuring, introduction of a new technology, or worker participation program. <strong>The initiative should be important to the company, represent a change, and have organizational implications</strong>.</p> <p>Your team will have met during Orientation and begun to work on various Core courses. The Team Project is introduced in the second OP class. A brief update report is required during Team Day. Although Team Day is primarily about helping you understand your own team better, it is also an opportunity to begin setting goals and planning the Team Project.</p> <p>Each team has a faculty advisor/coach who will be the main contact person for the teams and responsible for grading the written team reports. Prof. Carroll is the advisor for about one-half of the teams; the OP instructors and other OP faculty act as advisors for the other teams. We have a TA for all the teams regarding the Team Projects (there are separate OP TAs for each section). Teams are required to meet at least twice with their faculty advisor (for approximately one hour in late September/early October and again in November), but they may request additional meetings. One day prior to each of these required meetings, the teams must send to their faculty advisor a 2-page team self-reflection reporting on how the project is going and how the team is functioning as a project team.</p> <p>Teams will present what they have learned in an oral presentation in their Communication section near the end of the semester (see Communication syllabus in MIT course 15.280). These presentations will be aimed at the company as audience, not the OP professor or faculty advisor. See the Communication assignment for further detail. </p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Readings</h2> <p>Since the class is closely related to <em>Organizational Processes</em>, all readings are assigned through that course. In <em>Communication for Managers</em>, there are readings that may also be of use in the Team Project. </p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Schedule</h2> <p>The Team Project consists of three phases: entry, data collection, and report.</p> <p>First, teams identify and negotiate entry to an organization and determine the initiative they will study and the scope of their project in terms of the unit(s) of the organization, deliverables, etc.</p> <p>Teams must draft a <a href=\"/courses/sloan-school-of-management/15-328-team-project-fall-2003/project\">Letter of Agreement</a> to the organization describing the expectations around the Team Project. The assignment is due Oct. 9 and must be sent to the Team Project faculty advisor. The Communication faculty will also receive a copy, but they will not grade it. The Letter of Agreement should include a statement to the effect that the company liaison will be asked to fill out a brief evaluation form at the end of the project to be sent to the Faculty Advisor (the form is on the class server).</p> <p>The teams must have a meeting with the Team Project faculty advisor by October. One day prior to this meeting, each team must submit a 2-page team self-reflection reporting on how the project is going and how the team is functioning as a project team.</p> <p>Each team must submit a brief statement by October 9 describing the organization they are working with and the initiative they will be analyzing. This statement should also be given to the Communication faculty, for their reference but not for a grade. A <a href=\"/courses/sloan-school-of-management/15-328-team-project-fall-2003/project\">standard form for this statement</a> is on the class server.</p> <p>Second, teams collect data from the organization. This typically involves obtaining documents, searching the internet and other public information, interviewing organization members, directly observing meetings or other aspects of the organization, etc.</p> <p>There is a required second team meeting (usually one hour) with the Team Project faculty advisor in November. At this point, the teams should have collected much of their data and be thinking about what they have found. It is a good moment to discuss with the advisor what the report should contain, what additional data you may need, and any other questions. One day prior to this meeting, each team must submit a 2-page team self-reflection reporting on how the project is going and how the team is functioning as a project team.</p> <p>Third, teams analyze their observations and prepare their oral presentation for Communication and their written report for the faculty advisor.</p> <p>During the week of December 3 the teams present an oral report in the Communication course (15.280). These presentations will be aimed at the company as audience, and will be a good opportunity for the team to practice for an actual oral report-back to the company. The Communication faculty will grade the presentations as part of the Communication course. When possible, the Team Project faculty advisor will also listen to the reports, but because the OP sections are divided into smaller groups for the Communication course, it will not be physically possible for the advisors to hear all reports.</p> <p>The teams present a written report aimed at the faculty advisor, who grades the report.</p> <p>There is usually a deliverable to the organization, such as a written report or oral presentation. This is negotiated with the organization, but the advisor and the Communication faculty can help create a practical and useful product. Remember, the company liaison will be asked to return an evaluation form to the Faculty Advisor at the end of the project. This must be returned by December 17<strong>.</strong> If there is further contact with the company, such as an additional report or presentation in January, the company liaison can always send an updated evaluation form if they wish. </p> <p></p><h2 class=\"subhead\">Grading</h2> <p></p><p>The Team Project is graded as part of the OP course. The 6 units of OP and 3 units of Team Project are treated as a single 9-unit course, with the two grades &quot;locked&quot; together. Team members receive the same team grade for the written team project report but receive individual grades for the OP assignments.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Support</h2> <p>The Team Project is a relatively unstructured assignment that is challenging for some teams.

We will examine processes within the organization from the individual to the group to the organizational level of analysis. We will draw upon work from a variety of social science disciplines.</p> <p>Organizations as a fairly distinct field emerged only in the late 1940s, and most of its growth has occurred in the last 25 years. It encompasses a large, diverse, expanding, and changing literature. It has been characterized as pre-paradigmatic in the sense that there are not universal exemplars, approaches, or methods. Jim March has noted, &quot;The study of organizations is more a classical field of scholarship than a simple theoretical structure, and organization theory is a mosaic of ideas and empirical results rather than an axiomatic system.&quot;</p> <p>The philosophy of this course recognizes the impossibility of covering much of this vast and amorphous literature. Our aim will be to sample approaches and to evaluate their applicability to proposed studies of individuals, groups, and organizations. The course will present you with some of the major perspectives and controversies across topics and levels of analysis. You will achieve some familiarity with various theoretical lenses and be aware of the range of approaches and tradeoffs in using any one lens for analysis. Integration across topics, levels, and theories will be encouraged.</p> <p>This year we will enrich the course with a series of Behavioral and Policy Sciences guest faculty. This will help to give students an introduction to the range of viewpoints and approaches in BPS.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Requirements</h2> <p>The course is run as a seminar, although brief introductory lectures will sometimes be given. This means that students are responsible for discussing topics and readings. Each student is expected to do <strong>all</strong> the readings for each session and to be prepared to discuss and comment on all the readings (the exception to this is if a debate among competing viewpoints has been planned, with students specializing in particular readings). Our task will be to find ideas that are interesting and provocative in the readings. Although criticism is important, it is all too easy to find problems in empirical work and gaps in theories. Thus, we want to understand what is being attempted, what has been accomplished, and what the readings suggest about further extensions, refinements, and empirical research. The latter part of each session will be spent designing studies that can contribute to our knowledge.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Grading</h2> <p>Each student will be graded on three components:</p> <div class=\"maintabletemplate\"> <table class=\"tablewidth50\" summary=\"See table caption for summary.\"> <caption class=\"invisible\">Grading criteria.</caption> <thead align=\"left\"> <tr> <th scope=\"col\">ACTIVITIES</th> <th scope=\"col\">PERCENTAGES</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody align=\"left\"> <tr class=\"row\"> <td>Quality of in-class participation</td> <td>20%</td> </tr> <tr class=\"alt-row\"> <td>Weekly memos</td> <td>40%</td> </tr> <tr class=\"row\"> <td>A final seminar paper</td> <td>40%</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> </div> <div class=\"help slide-bottom\"> <div class=\"help-message\"> <a class=\"help-engage\" href=\"javascript: trackEvents('Bottom Get Started','bottom get started Click','Help Overlay');\">Need help getting started?</a> <a href=\"javascript:disableHelpPopup(); trackEvents('Bottom Don\\'t Show','bottom don\\'t show Click','Help Overlay');\" class=\"help-dismiss\">Don't show me this again</a> </div> </div> <div class=\"help popup-center\"> <div class=\"help-message\"> <p class=\"help-dismiss\"><a href=\"javascript:disableHelpPopup(); trackEvents('Popup Don\\'t Show','popup don\\'t show Click','Help Overlay');\">Don't show me this again</a></p> <h2>Welcome!</h2> <p>This is one of over 2,200 courses on OCW.

It does not deal with specific techniques per se, but rather with the assumptions and the logic underlying social research. Students become acquainted with a variety of approaches to research design, and are helped to develop their own research projects and to evaluate the products of empirical research.</p> <p>Students will work in groups to design and carry out a small research project. Group results will be presented orally to the class at various points during the semester, with a final public presentation that will be open to the Sloan community. A group written report is due at the end of the semester.

This course is designed to provide an introduction to some of the most commonly used quantitative techniques, including logit/probit models, count models, event history models, and pooled cross-section techniques.</p> <p>This is a course about the research process. My explicit goal is to help you understand the relationship between theory, data and statistical methods. In that sense this is not a course in statistical theory; we will not spend a lot of time deriving likelihood functions, etc., although we will be explicit about the assumptions underlying the statistical procedures. Instead, this is a course in how to use statistical techniques to answer research questions. We will spend considerable time thinking about how theoretical insights can be translated into testable propositions, and how those propositions are best tested. We will do this through discussions of published research from leading journals in organizational research, and by having you work with data and estimate models. My primary goal in these skills is to help you increase your comfort with using statistical methods to ask and answer research questions, and to develop critical skills in evaluating others' research, such that you might apply those skills to your own.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Format and Requirements</h2> <p>The structure of the course involves (roughly) alternating lectures on the principles associated with a particular method in one week, followed the next week by the application of those models. We will pursue two types of application:</p> <ul> <li>First, we will discuss working papers (found on the Internet and elsewhere) that use the particular methods in question, with an eye toward assessing whether the data and methods are appropriate for the research question.<br /> <br /> </li> <li>Second, I will ask students to work with data to estimate models (in STATAÂ®), write up an interpretation of the results, and then (occasionally) present the results in class.</li> </ul> <p>Some words about the data assignments are in order. Most importantly, these assignments are deliberately open-ended. I will not specify what the dependent variable should be, what you are trying to explain, etc. Part of the goal of these exercises is to give you practice with working with data, estimating models and making sense of the results. In the language of <a href=\"/courses/sloan-school-of-management/15-347-doctoral-seminar-in-research-methods-i-fall-2004/index.htm\">15.347</a>, I want you to formulate a conceptual model of the data as well as a statistical model. The major constraint is that you apply the method discussed during that week's class (e.g., count models). I will make appropriate datasets available for this purpose, but you are also allowed to use your own data sources.</p> <p>At the beginning of class in each &quot;Application&quot; week, I ask that you hand in a brief summary of the results of your analysis. This summary should be a maximum of two pages of text, plus any tables and figures, and should discuss the results in light of the conceptual model you have developed. <strong>These assignments may be done in groups of up to two people</strong>. I will ask two or three groups each week to present the results of their work, so that we may discuss them as a class.</p> <p>The grading is broken down as follows:</p> <div class=\"maintabletemplate\"> <table class=\"tablewidth50\" summary=\"See table caption for summary.\"> <caption class=\"invisible\">Table for Gradings.</caption> <thead align=\"left\"> <tr class=\"tableheader\"> <th id=\"col1\" scope=\"col\" abbr=\"Week Number\">ACTIVITIES</th> <th id=\"col2\" scope=\"col\">PERCENTAGES</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody align=\"left\"> <tr class=\"row\"> <td headers=\"col1\">Class participation</td> <td headers=\"col2\">30%</td> </tr> <tr class=\"alt-row\"> <td headers=\"col1\">Discussion leadership for one of the assigned working papers</td> <td headers=\"col2\">20%</td> </tr> <tr class=\"row\"> <td headers=\"col1\">The five short assignments that involve working with data</td> <td headers=\"col2\">50%</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> </div> <h3 class=\"subsubhead\">Software</h3> <p>If you have not worked with STATAÂ® before, I encourage you to do things during the first few weeks of class:</p> <ol> <li>Get yourself set up (e.g., in the computer lab) so that you know how to get it going and<br /> <br /> </li> <li>At least look through some of the manuals.

It is also appropriate for people interested in the industry or in working as an industry analyst. Many of the issues we discuss are highly relevant for companies whose businesses are heavily dependent on software, such as e-business or financial services, or embedded software for industrial applications.</p> <p>We start by considering key topics in high-tech company strategy and market positioning. We will also review the history of how software became a business at IBM and other companies, ranging from early developments in services to the emergence of a products business and attempts to exploit open-source software. Then we examine in some detail the approach to strategy, organization, and product development at MicrosoftÂ®, arguably the world's largest and most successful dedicated software company. We also analyze some new software technologies and companies and consider the business opportunities much as would a venture capitalist. Finally, in the last part of the course, students form teams and analyze a small set of &quot;interesting&quot; and &quot;emerging&quot; software technology areas and companies that they select with the approval of the instructor.</p> <p>In general, we emphasize the excitement, as well as the difficulties, of managing in a fast-paced high-tech environment where it is difficult to plan more than 6 to 12 months ahead and where strategic, organizational, and technological flexibility are of paramount importance. We consider also how the key assets of such high-tech organizations are its products and its people. The instructor has written a text for the course, titled <em>The Business of Software</em>, based on his research and topics covered in this class in prior years, as well as a profile of MicrosoftÂ®, <em>MicrosoftÂ® Secrets</em> , that we draw on for the course. There are also a number of other required and recommended readings to supplement the text, as well as videos and some guest speakers.</p> <p>This year we also have a guest senior lecturer, Imran Sayeed, who will participate in the course and help organize several sessions, particularly on software entrepreneurship and global development. Mr. Sayeed is the co-founder and chairman of NetNumina Solutions, a custom software design and development company acquired by Keane, Inc. in March 2005.</p> <p>A key feature of the course is that we will share what we know and learn during the semester. We ask student teams to volunteer for some of the sessions to provide additional perspectives on the topics. They will meet with the instructors before class and then prepare discussion issues and brief presentations for the class. Each presenting group is also required to prepare a handout for class, including a one-page wrap-up sheet for the day on &quot;lessons learned&quot; or &quot;takeaways&quot; from the day's materials.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Grading</h2> <p>Grading will consist of approximately 25% class participation, 30% from three short essays on the readings and lectures (&quot;reaction papers&quot;), 15% from student team presentations to supplement the lectures, and 30% from the team project papers.</p> <div class=\"maintabletemplate\"> <table class=\"tablewidth50\" summary=\"See table caption for summary.\"> <caption class=\"invisible\">Grading criteria.</caption> <thead align=\"left\"> <tr> <th scope=\"col\">Activities</th> <th scope=\"col\">Percentages</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody align=\"left\"> <tr class=\"row\"> <td>Class Participation</td> <td>25%</td> </tr> <tr class=\"alt-row\"> <td>Three Short Essays</td> <td>30%</td> </tr> <tr class=\"row\"> <td>Student Team Presentations</td> <td>15%</td> </tr> <tr class=\"alt-row\"> <td>Team Project Papers</td> <td>30%</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> </div> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Required Reading</h2> <p><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/074321580X/ref=nosim/mitopencourse-20\"><img alt=\"Buy at Amazon\" src=\"/images/a_logo_17.gif\" align=\"absMiddle\" border=\"0\" /></a> Cusumano, Michael A. <em>The Business of Software: What Every Manager, Programmer, and Entrepreneur Must Know in Good Times and Bad</em>.

This course has four central themes: (1) How to think analytically about designing organizational systems, (2) How leaders, especially founders, play a critical role in shaping an organization's culture, (3) What really needs to be done to build a successful organization for the long-term; and (4) What you can do to improve your personal likelihood of success. </p> <p>This is not a survey course in entrepreneurship or in leadership. Instead, this course addresses the principles of organizational architecture, group behavior and performance, interpersonal influence, leadership and motivation in entrepreneurial settings. A primary goal is to develop your competencies in organizational design, human resources management, leadership and organizational behavior in the context of a new, small firm. </p> <p>For many entrepreneurs, the most pressing questions (aside from those about financing) are about how to locate and recruit talented people, and how to manage and keep them, and how to build a high-growth, long-term, sustainable firm. This course will address these questions and will provide you with a number of critical concepts and competencies that will be useful to you in both the short and long term. Throughout the course there will be a dual emphasis on thinking systematically and strategically about aspects of managing a rapidly growing organization, and on the actual implementation challenges associated with management and leadership.</p> <p>The primary course material will be a series of cases illustrating both successes and failures. You will also be provided with supplementary readings and lectures that will supply concepts and frameworks. It is important that we take advantage of the experience of class members. So, where relevant, please feel free to bring your own experiences and illustrations into class discussion. Throughout the course--virtually in every session--we will consider how what we are discussing differs across settings. Students with global experiences are especially encouraged to bring this knowledge into the classroom. The employment relationship in the U.S. is different in many respects from many other countries, so it is important that as managers we appreciate these differences in how human resources might be framed differently in other cultures. If we are to meet our goal of increasing your effectiveness in leading and managing, it is important to explore how, why, and under what circumstances various approaches work. Your previous experience, both positive and negative, is a valuable source of data for this learning.</p> <p>The course is organized into three main modules: Setting Direction, Building Skills &amp; Capabilities, and Sustaining Momentum. In each module there will be a series of cases and readings. The course opens with a two-day case series that will foreshadow each of the topics covered in the course. Similarly, the course ends with a two-day capstone case-series that will allow students to apply the lessons learned.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Course Requirements</h2> <p>Class Participation: 50% of grade<br /> Course Project: 50% of grade<br /> Optional Case Write-ups: extra credit toward class participation<br /> Note: All written submissions for this course must be professionally prepared, well-researched and documented, with reasonable fonts and margins. </p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Course Project</h2> <p>For complete description, see Project section.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Class Participation</h2> <p>Because this is a case-based class, each student is required to be an active participant in case discussions. Your participation grade will reflect my assessment of your total contribution to the learning environment. This includes not only the frequency of your contributions in class, but also their quality. Quality, includes, among other things: (1) sound, rigorous, and insightful diagnosis (e.g. sharpening of key issues, depth and relevance of analysis); (2) ability to draw on course materials and your own experience productively; (3) ability to advance or sharpen in-class discussion and debate, willingness to take risky or unpopular points of view, use of logic, precision, and evidence in making arguments; (4) professionalism of your conduct (attendance, punctuality, preparedness, and showing respect to all section members and their class contributions). Unexcused absences and lack of preparation will be counted heavily against your grade.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Case Write-ups</h2> <p>Some students may be more comfortable demonstrating their mastery of core course concepts in written rather than in oral form. To accommodate those students, there are two opportunities for students to submit written case analyses (no more than 5 pages long).</p> <p>Case Write-up 1:<br /> Apple Computer (A) (Abridged): Corporate Strategy and Culture, HBS# 495-044<br /> Due before class, session 8.</p> <p>Case Write-up 2:<br /> Wolfgang Keller at Konigsbrau-Hellas A. E. (A), HBS # 498-045<br /> Due before class, session 16.</p> <p>Case write-ups are entirely optional and will be counted as extra credit towards class participation grades. The write-ups will be evaluated according to how well you have demonstrated your mastery of the course material. This includes the application of appropriate conceptual materials; the effective use of evidence to develop your arguments; explicit assumptions and clear logical inferences; and a coherent and integrated analysis and assessment. In addition the written work must be clear and well-organized. Case write-ups should be typed, with reasonable fonts and margins.</p> <div class=\"help slide-bottom\"> <div class=\"help-message\"> <a class=\"help-engage\" href=\"javascript: trackEvents('Bottom Get Started','bottom get started Click','Help Overlay');\">Need help getting started?</a> <a href=\"javascript:disableHelpPopup(); trackEvents('Bottom Don\\'t Show','bottom don\\'t show Click','Help Overlay');\" class=\"help-dismiss\">Don't show me this again</a> </div> </div> <div class=\"help popup-center\"> <div class=\"help-message\"> <p class=\"help-dismiss\"><a href=\"javascript:disableHelpPopup(); trackEvents('Popup Don\\'t Show','popup don\\'t show Click','Help Overlay');\">Don't show me this again</a></p> <h2>Welcome!</h2> <p>This is one of over 2,200 courses on OCW.

The emphasis will be on linking corporate finance to other aspects of corporate strategy. There are three main modules of the course.</p> <ol> <li><strong>Financing Needs and Capital Structure:</strong> The course starts with analyzing the factors that determine a companyâs need for external financing, be it debt or equity. We then move on to a consideration of the optimal mix of debt and equity financing.</li> <li><strong>Project and Company Valuation:</strong> In the second module, we develop the tools needed for valuing investment projects, including the determination of the relevant cash flows and the appropriate discount rate. We will then use these basic tools to value companies, and to select investment projects.</li> <li><strong>Selected Topics:</strong> The final module deals with selected aspects of modern corporate finance, most likely including Risk Management and Corporate Governance. The actual topics will be determined by the time available, and by the interests of students.</li> </ol> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Teaching Methods</h2> <p>We will present the basic insights of corporate finance theory, but emphasize the application of theory to real business decisions. Each session will involve class discussion. In some instances, discussion will be centered on lectures; in others it will be centered on a business case. Your participation is critical to the success of the course. You are expected to read all cases, come to class, and participate in class discussion.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">The Team</h2> <ul> <li>Prof. Dirk Jenter, Section A</li> <li>Prof. Katharina Lewellen, Section B</li> </ul> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Prerequisites</h2> <p>Finance Theory I (15.401). It will also help if you know some basic economics and accounting.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Sections</h2> <p>There are two sections.

The course is a combination of lectures and cases. Unless you have the time to thoroughly prepare the cases, we strongly recommend that you not take the course. Each case will come with <a href=\"/courses/sloan-school-of-management/15-402-finance-theory-ii-spring-2003/assignments\">guideline questions</a>. Students are required to submit a two-page memorandum on the cases. Students are required to work in teams of no more than five. Teams with less than three people are strongly discouraged. Only one memorandum need be handed in for a given group. You have the option of not handing in two cases during the semester. There are four required cases: Wilson Lumber, MCI Communications, Dixon, and Ameritrade. Note that Wilson Lumber 1 and 2 count as one case.</p> <p>The memorandums should be typed and double-spaced. They should be written as if your were presenting it to your business colleagues. The two-page limit is for text only. You may attach as many numerical calculations as you wish. Memorandums will not be accepted after the class has met.</p> <p>Class attendance and participation in case discussions is critical to the learning process. While the Brealey and Myers textbook is required, this book will often only provide a background for us. We will cover a lot of material that is not actually in the book.</p> <p>The teaching assistant will be helping with administrative matters. The teaching assistants' main responsibility will be grading case write-ups, answering questions during office hours, and holding one or two review sessions.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Course Policies are Designed to Ensure Fairness</h2> <p>My goals are to meet the course objectives and to ensure that the course is graded fairly. By remaining enrolled in the course, you agree to abide by the policies detailed below. If you anticipate that you cannot abide by these policies (e.g., because you know that you have a conflict with an exam because of vacation travel or travel in connection with an interview), please either re-arrange your schedule or arrange to take this course another time.</p> <p>Exams cannot be rescheduled or made up<em>.</em> Treat these dates as you would an important meeting in the business world -- that means that unless you are actually hacking-up a lung, you had better be there. In the unlikely event that you are faced with unforeseeable and unavoidable circumstances that will cause you to miss the exam you must talk to me immediately.</p> <p>Financial calculators will be allowed during the exams. However, quantitative answers that do not show work do not earn points. The exams are cumulative in the sense that the material covered on the final exam builds upon the material from the mid-term.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Re-grades</h2> <p>The TAs and I will work hard to ensure that the same partial credit is allocated to the same partially correct answer on each exam. Occasionally, we will make mistakes in our grading, and we are eager to correct mistakes subject to the following limits. If you believe that there was a mistake in the grading of your exam, within one week following the return of the exam, submit the original exam and a separate <strong>written explanation</strong> of the points of contention to me. If the re-grade request is made after one week or without an accompanying written explanation, no re-grade will be given. <strong>There are no exceptions to the preceding rule</strong><em>.</em> All re-grade decisions are <strong>final</strong><em>.</em> We reserve the right to correct all mistakes made during grading an exam submitted for a re-grade.</p> <p><strong>Special Arrangements and Exam Conflicts</strong></p> <p>If you have a documented disability and anticipate the need for accommodations in this course, please make arrangements as soon as possible.</p> <p>Documented evidence that you were seriously ill or had a serious emergency at the scheduled time of an exam are the only valid excuses for missing an exam. In order to be excused from an exam, you must contact me <strong>prior to the exam</strong> and be ready to provide me with documentation after the exam.</p> <div class=\"help slide-bottom\"> <div class=\"help-message\"> <a class=\"help-engage\" href=\"javascript: trackEvents('Bottom Get Started','bottom get started Click','Help Overlay');\">Need help getting started?</a> <a href=\"javascript:disableHelpPopup(); trackEvents('Bottom Don\\'t Show','bottom don\\'t show Click','Help Overlay');\" class=\"help-dismiss\">Don't show me this again</a> </div> </div> <div class=\"help popup-center\"> <div class=\"help-message\"> <p class=\"help-dismiss\"><a href=\"javascript:disableHelpPopup(); trackEvents('Popup Don\\'t Show','popup don\\'t show Click','Help Overlay');\">Don't show me this again</a></p> <h2>Welcome!</h2> <p>This is one of over 2,200 courses on OCW.

The topics covered in this course can be broadly categorized into five groups:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Financial Theories<br /> </strong>This includes portfolio theory, the capital asset pricing model and the arbitrage pricing theory, all of which have become an integrated part of the decision-making in investments.</li> <li><strong>Empirical Evidence in the Equity and Equity Options Markets<br /> </strong>This includes patterns in cross-sections of stock returns, the time-series behavior of stock returns time-varying expected returns and stochastic volatility, and further empirical evidence from the equity options market.</li> <li><strong>Introduction to Fixed-Income and Credit Sensitive Instruments<br /> </strong>This includes default-free as well as defaultable bonds, yield curve analysis, the effect of Fed target rates, fixed-income derivatives such as swaps, caps, floors, and swaptions, models of default and ratings transitions, and more recent development of credit derivatives.</li> <li><strong>Market Efficiency and &quot;Active&quot; Investments<br /> </strong>We start with the efficient market hypothesis, which is a useful framework for modeling financial markets. Like any model, the efficient market hypothesis is not a perfect description of reality: some prices are almost certainly &quot;wrong&quot;. Hence there are reasons to believe that active management can have effective results. Topics in active investments include security analysis, active portfolio management, hedge funds, and risk management issues.</li> <li><strong>Brief Introduction to Behavioral Finance<br /> </strong>While traditional finance assumes investors act rationally to maximize a well-defined utility function, behavioral finance tries to use other theories of behavior, from psychology, sociology, and anthropology, to explain financial markets. This topic will be covered by just one lecture, the main purpose of which is to get you exposed to this active and fast growing field in Finance.</li> </ul> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Course Objectives</h2> <p>A sound investment decision requires in-depth knowledge of the financial markets, rigorous analytical thinking and precise mathematical derivation. The main objective of this class is to teach you these three elements:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Analytical Tools<br /> </strong>Among others, an important analytical skill you should acquire from taking this class is the ability to transform a real life investment problem into an analytically tractable model. This modeling skill is an important aspect of this class, and will be emphasized throughout the course.</li> <li><strong>Quantitative Skills<br /> </strong>Modern finance has its quantitative aspect. Powerful mathematical techniques such as optimization, dynamic programming, probability theory and statistical analysis pave the way for many complex investment problems.<br /> In this class, you will be exposed to this quantitative aspect. You are not expected to be fluent in mathematics, but I hope to teach you the fundamentals, which are portable from one situation to another. Moreover, through 5 group assignments, you will have hands-on experiences with optimization, data analysis, Monte-Carlo simulation, etc.</li> <li><strong>Empirical Knowledge<br /> </strong>Essential to any investment decision is the knowledge of the investment environment. Broadly speaking, the financial instruments can be categorized into equity, debt, and derivatives. Important empirical evidence from all three types of financial markets will be examined in this class. Although I will emphasize concepts and the big picture a lot, please realize that 15.433 involves a fair bit of algebra, notation, and basic mathematics. So if you are uncomfortable with the above three notions, please talk to the course instructor about it.</li> </ul> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Course Materials</h2> <p>Required Reading<br /> Bodie, Zvi, Alex Kane, and Alan J.

Accounting attempts to measure and report corporate performance. Users demand the performance measure in a variety of decisions they make. For example,</p> <ol> <li>Managers use accounting information in making investment decisions;</li> <li>Investors use accounting information in valuing stocks;</li> <li>Bankers rely on accounting information in deciding whether to lend money to a business and in assessing the risk of the loan; and</li> <li>Accounting information is crucial in evaluating the performance of employees at various levels in an organization.</li> </ol> <p>In making all of these decisions, an interdisciplinary understanding of the entire business is necessary. Toward this end, the course also introduces concepts from finance and economics (e.g., cash flow discounting, risk, valuation, and criteria for choosing among alternative investments) throughout the course, which will enable students to place accounting in the context of a business.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Teaching Instructor Sessions</h2> <p>The Teaching Instructors are important members of the teaching team and are committed to helping the class reach the course objectives.

Many at the forefront of accounting education have goals generally consistent with this course objective. For example, Dr. Jean Wyer, a former accounting professor who refers to herself as &quot;Dean&quot; of Cooper &amp; Lybrand's educational programs, told soon-to-be professors at an Accounting Doctoral Consortium to abandon debits and credits. To paraphrase Dr. Wyer:</p> <blockquote> <p>You should not be teaching debits and credits; they are a holdover from the past that were needed to balance entries and accounts before we had computers. Modern electronic information systems do not have T-accounts or journal entries, and students need only understand a lesson taught the first day of an algebra course to master bookkeeping concepts: Assets = Liabilities + Owners' Equity.</p> </blockquote> <p>Because 15.514 is likely quite different than you might expect, the next few pages provides an overview of our objectives, how we plan to get there, and additional details about how each class will be structured.</p> <p>The essential elements of our strategy to help you reach the course goal is outlined in the course challenges. In addition, the structure of each day's class and related assignments are designed complement the challenges.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Course Challenges</h2> <p>The course goal is divided into five subordinate challenges that can help you organize the way you learn accounting. For example, they can help you distinguish situations where there is a correct answer from those where judgment is required. You can view the challenges as a series of questions you will ask yourself later in your career as either a preparer or user of accounting information. To reach the course goal, you must meet all five challenges and understand how they relate to each other. Acknowledgement is hereby given to Professor G. Peter Wilson for his authorship of The Five Challenges.</p> <p><strong>1. The record keeping and reporting challenge<br /> </strong><em>As a preparer</em> of accounting reports (accountant, chief financial officer, controller, or other responsible party), having determined the numbers you want to record for an economic event and having made related accounting or tax policy choices (e.g., having decided to recognize revenues, capitalize expenditures, or claim investment tax credits), how do you record this event, how does it affect accounting reports, and how do you subsequently aggregate information from this event and others to create these reports? <em>As a user</em> of accounting reports (investor, creditor, employee, or other stakeholder), given the accounting numbers management reported for an economic event and their accounting choices, you will want to know how the numbers were recorded and how they affect accounting reports (financial statements, managerial reports, and tax reports). For example, as a user, given that depreciation expense is $10, you will want to know how it was recorded and how this entry impacts financial statements.</p> <p><strong>2. The computation challenge<br /> </strong><em>As a preparer,</em> having chosen the accounting method you will use to measure an economic event from the acceptable alternatives and having made all of the assumptions about the related business activity that are needed to apply this method, how do you compute the number reported in challenge 1? <em>As a user,</em> knowing the accounting procedures management used to produce the numbers recorded in challenge 1 and the information that was needed to execute them, such as management's assumptions about the related business activity, how would you compute them yourself? For example, as a preparer or user, knowing that a zero-coupon bond matures in 10 years, how do you use the implicit interest rate to compute the periodic interest expense?</p> <p><strong>3. The judgment challenge</strong><br /> <em>As a preparer,</em> given your knowledge about the underlying business activity, your choices of acceptable accounting procedures, and your own incentives, how do you choose an accounting procedure and exercise related judgment concerning measurement, recognition, and disclosure? <em>As a user,</em> who has access to less information than preparers about this business activity and about preparers' personal incentives to report or misrepresent it, how do you judge the usefulness of numbers reported in challenge 2 to your decision? For example, as a user, how do you evaluate the assumptions management made when they computed depreciation, including the useful life, residual value, and pattern of future expenses? Do you have access to enough information? Ideally, what other related information would you like to have to address your decision?</p> <p><strong>4. The usage challenge<br /> </strong><em>As a preparer,</em> to exercise the judgment in challenge 3, how do you first learn as much as possible about the decisions that will be influenced by the reported numbers and the consequences of these decisions on yourself, your reporting entity, and users? As a user, how can the reported numbers help you make a more informed decision? For example, how can you use them to assess the reporting entity's performance and how can you benchmark these performance measures against their historical counterparts, competitors' comparables, and strategic targets? <em>As a user,</em> to meet challenge 3, you will also need to know as much as possible about how others use these numbers and the consequences of their decisions (and your own) on management's reporting and business decisions.</p> <p><strong>5. The search challenge</strong><br /> As either a user or a preparer, how do you locate the information needed to meet challenges 1-4?</p> <p>The first two challenges relate to procedural activities that generally have a right answer and are most often associated with accounting (e.g., bookkeeping, tax compliance, and producing managerial reports). Traditionally, introductory financial, managerial, and tax accounting courses have focused almost exclusively on these challenges. The judgment challenge is the most difficult to master because it is contextual - you learn judgment by analyzing actual business decisions. The richer the description of the business context in the practice problems you study and the more you know about the reporting managers' character and incentives and reporting alternatives, the more you will be preparing yourself to deal with complex judgments. The search challenge is a prerequisite for the other four challenges. For example, users of financial reports must first know where companies report their accounting policies to judge the quality of the related numbers (meet the judgment challenge) and they must know where to find the appropriate formulas to meet the computation challenge. Some of the other challenges are also interdependent. For example, users must understand how the numbers were computed to judge their usefulness.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Conduct</h2> <p>Professional conduct is built upon the idea of mutual respect. Such conduct entails (but is not necessarily limited to):</p> <ul> <li> Attending the class. Each class benefits from the attendance and participation of all students. </li> <li> Arriving on time. Late arrivals are disruptive to both lectures and class discussion, and show disrespect to those who are on time. </li> <li> Minimizing disruptions. Cell phones and pagers should be turned off during class. You should not leave and re-enter the class. You should avoid engaging in side conversations after class has begun. </li> <li> Focusing on the class. While you may take notes on laptops, do not use laptop computers or hand-held devices for other tasks while in class. Activities such as net surfing, day trading, and answering email are very impolite and disruptive both to neighbors and the class. </li> <li> Being prepared for class. You should be ready to discuss any assigned readings and to answer any assigned questions for each day's class, including being ready to open a case assigned for that day. </li> <li> Respect. You should act respectfully toward all class participants. Class participation grading reflects student adherence to these principles; students gain credit for contributing valuable insights and students lose credit if they fail to adhere to any of the above guidelines. </li> </ul> <div class=\"help slide-bottom\"> <div class=\"help-message\"> <a class=\"help-engage\" href=\"javascript: trackEvents('Bottom Get Started','bottom get started Click','Help Overlay');\">Need help getting started?</a> <a href=\"javascript:disableHelpPopup(); trackEvents('Bottom Don\\'t Show','bottom don\\'t show Click','Help Overlay');\" class=\"help-dismiss\">Don't show me this again</a> </div> </div> <div class=\"help popup-center\"> <div class=\"help-message\"> <p class=\"help-dismiss\"><a href=\"javascript:disableHelpPopup(); trackEvents('Popup Don\\'t Show','popup don\\'t show Click','Help Overlay');\">Don't show me this again</a></p> <h2>Welcome!</h2> <p>This is one of over 2,200 courses on OCW.

In contrast, traditional tax accounting courses concentrate on administrative issues while ignoring the richness of the context in which tax factors operate. The objective of the course is to bridge this gap by providing a framework for recognizing tax planning opportunities and applying basic principles of tax strategy.</p> <p>The key themes in this conceptual framework are:</p> <ul> <li> <p><em>All Parties</em> Effective tax planning requires the planner to consider the tax implications of a proposed transaction for all parties to the transaction. In many cases, it is differences in tax status that create tax arbitrage opportunities.</p> </li> <li> <p><em>All Taxes</em> Effective tax planning requires considering both explicit taxes (taxes paid directly to the government) and implicit taxes (taxes paid indirectly in the form of lower before-tax rates of return on tax-favored investments).</p> </li> <li> <p><em>All Costs</em> Effective tax planning requires the planner to recognize that taxes represent only one among many business costs, and all costs must be considered in the planning process.</p> </li> </ul> <p>The course begins with some basic analytical tools of this framework. The role that taxes may play in business decisions are presented within the life-cycle of a firm, from the tax issues at start up (e.g., the choice of organizational form), the compensation of workers (e.g., current and deferred compensation, stock options), investment opportunities (e.g., stocks, bonds, annuities), capital structure and dividend policy, multistate and multinational operations, financial innovations, and mergers and acquisitions.</p> <p>An ultimate goal of the course is to provide you with an approach to thinking about taxes that will be valuable even as the tax laws change. A useful by-product of this approach is the ability to think critically about current tax reform proposals.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Course Materials</h2> <h3 class=\"subsubhead\">Text</h3> <p>Scholes, Wolfson, Erickson, Maydew and Shevlin. <em>Taxes and Business Strategy - A Planning Approach.</em> 2nd ed.

                    "syllabus": "<div id=\"course_inner_section\"> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Course Meeting Times</h2> <p>Lectures: 3 sessions / week, 1.5 hours / session</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Overview</h2> <p>In this class, we focus on how managers can use accounting information to assist them in making decisions and how accounting information can be used to control the actions of other members of the firm. We will use managerial and organizational economics to build a framework for understanding internal accounting systems. Then we will apply these theoretical constructs to actual real world managerial decision problems. As such, you should plan to gain familiarity with the topics by working through the suggested problems. Much of the information in this course builds upon key concepts covered in the first half of the class. Falling behind early is not a good idea.</p> <p>I believe that the best way to learn material is to gain experience through problem solving. During the course we will spend a substantial amount of time applying the material covered in this class on real world managerial decisions. As such, we will rely considerably on cases to motivate discussion during class sessions.</p> <p>The conceptual materials for the course are provided in the textbook, <em>Accounting for Decision Making and Control</em> (4th edition) by Jerry Zimmerman. Reading and problems from this book are assigned for many class sessions. The primary goal of the readings is to help you to develop a framework with which you can analyze accounting and control problems in a variety of management contexts.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Course Requirements</h2> <p>The most important requirements for this course are a thorough preparation and analysis of the assigned cases, problems, and reading material, and active participation in the classroom. The cases included in this course represent broad organizational situations. In some instances, the case may represent a good system and you are expected to learn what makes the system work well. Other problems may present a system that has failed and the objective should be to learn from the failures. Most cases seldom present examples of absolutely perfect or totally flawed systems. There are always some weaknesses in the best of management practices. However, the evaluation of these weaknesses is always relative to the resources required to correct the weaknesses. Thus, it may be costly to remove flaws. When analyzing cases, any recommendation for changes should carefully weigh the organizational costs involved.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Grading</h2> <p>There are several unique aspects to the grading system that will be employed for this course. Your grade will consist of four components a group case write up, a group project, and a final exam. The relative weighting of these components are as follows:</p> <p>1 Case write-up to be done on a group basis 20%<br /> 2 Case write-up done individually 40%<br /> 1 Exam - Case write-up 40%<br /> </p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Problem Sets</h2> <p>On the day before any scheduled lecture (non-case days) I will provide a problem set that has been selected to help you apply the theoretical material covered under the relevant topic. To make our time in class more productive, I encourage you to read the assigned materials and sketch out solutions to the problems prior to the start of each class.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Case Write-up</h2> <p>Case write-ups (whether they be individual or by group) are to be maximum of four pages of text (typed, double spaced, 12 point &quot;Times&quot; font, 1 inch/2.5 cm margins) plus exhibits.</p> <p>Your write-ups should be a comprehensive analysis of the case. It is not sufficient to simply answer the questions assigned for the class discussion for that day. Indeed, you should treat those questions merely as a guide to get you started on analyzing the case. You have not completed a case analysis until you are prepared to make a well-reasoned managerial recommendation supported with balanced arguments identifying the advantages and disadvantages of that recommendation.</p> <p>Please bear in mind that the write-up should illustrate your reasoning, defend it with proof and backup material, and present and support your conclusions and recommendations. You should assume that the reader is familiar with the facts in the case. It may be helpful to think of an executive who is very busy and is not likely to spend a lot of time trying to decipher your report. Use of visual cues and format to emphasize your main points will increase their impact. </p> <p>If you attach exhibits to your write-up, refer to those exhibits in the text, explaining what you want the reader to take away from any given exhibit.</p> <p>Your case write-up should be submitted at the start of class on the date that case will be discussed. Because the case will be discussed in detail in class, no assignments will be accepted after the start of the class.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Exam</h2> <p>There will be a final exam in the course. The final exam is cumulative and is designed to be a test of your comprehension of the technical and conceptual material discussed in the classes. The exam will be an open book open notes exam, that will be similar to many of the cases covered in class. The best way to prepare for the exam is to prepare carefully for each of the classes which precedes it. If you do that, then you will need to do little studying immediately prior to the exam. Additional details regarding the timing of the exam will be provided during the first week of classes.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">In the Classroom</h2> <p>My expectation is that you will come to the class having already thought through and analyzed the assigned problems and cases. This way, we can devote the bulk of the class time to thinking about and responding to each other's analyses of the problems and cases and only the necessary minimum to getting the facts out.</p> <p>I encourage active student participation in class. I should point out that most students typically tend to <em>under</em>-estimate - rather than <em>over</em>-estimate - the worth of what they have to say. Thus, if you are ever in doubt, I would encourage you to speak up instead of staying quiet.</p> <p>The vast majority of managers' interactions with others are oral. Managers generally spend very little time reading, and even less time writing reports. The classroom should be considered a laboratory in which you can test your ability to convince your peers of the validity of your approach. Some people learn more by listening to others than they do by engaging in discussions themselves. Thus, while it is essential for the success of this course that we have excellent class discussions, it is not necessary that everybody actively participate all the time.</p> <p>I hope that you will be highly energized the night before class when you are preparing for the cases and lectures, and relaxed during class. In class discussions we will be hard on ideas, but soft on people. My past experience suggests that if you spend several hours preparing and the class environment is intellectually vibrant, but not intimidating, you will want to participate. Please note that there is no need to contribute in every class. Some of the best contributors have been those who participated in only a handful of sessions. Their contributions, however, were truly insightful and persuasive. The issue is one of <em>quality</em> not quantity or frequency.</p> <p>Most class sessions with an assigned case will begin with one student being asked to take 5 minutes to provide an analysis of the case. An effective lead-off can do a great deal to enhance class discussion. It sets the tone and quality level and encourages the class to probe more deeply into the issues of the case. After the individual lead-off presentation, the discussion will be opened to the remainder of the group. Others may choose to build on the lead-off discussion, to present a significantly different alternative, or focus sharply on one or more issues which seem to have been developed inadequately or perhaps overlooked.</p> <p>My role in the class is to help facilitate discussion. In part, I serve as a recording secretary, clarifier, and intensive questioner in order to help you present and develop your ideas. I manage the class process to ensure that the class achieves an understanding of the case situation. Clearly, there is no single correct solution to any of these problems. There are, however, a number of wrong solutions. There are also solutions which are inadequately supported with analysis, and there are solutions and analyses which are ineffective because they are not presented in an orderly and persuasive fashion. We should work together to see to it that each class session is a lively, stimulating, and intellectually rewarding venture in group learning. We are individually and collectively responsible for achieving that end.</p> <p>Each case has its own integrity and, thus, it stands on its own. You may draw on personal experiences if you believe they are substantive, insightful, and generalizable. Generally, we are not concerned with what was the actual outcome of the case. Such an approach would imply that there was a &quot;right answer.&quot; The outcome of a situation may or may not reflect a good solution. In those instances where there was a particularly interesting outcome, it will be shared with the class.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Lecture Slides, Problem Solutions and Other Handouts</h2> <p>I will distribute lecture slides at the beginning of each class and homework solutions at the end of each class.</p> <div class=\"help slide-bottom\"> <div class=\"help-message\"> <a class=\"help-engage\" href=\"javascript: trackEvents('Bottom Get Started','bottom get started Click','Help Overlay');\">Need help getting started?</a> <a href=\"javascript:disableHelpPopup(); trackEvents('Bottom Don\\'t Show','bottom don\\'t show Click','Help Overlay');\" class=\"help-dismiss\">Don't show me this again</a> </div> </div> <div class=\"help popup-center\"> <div class=\"help-message\"> <p class=\"help-dismiss\"><a href=\"javascript:disableHelpPopup(); trackEvents('Popup Don\\'t Show','popup don\\'t show Click','Help Overlay');\">Don't show me this again</a></p> <h2>Welcome!</h2> <p>This is one of over 2,200 courses on OCW.

There will be a special emphasis on networks and distributed computing. Students will also gain some hands-on exposure to powerful, high-level tools for making computers do amazing things, without the need for conventional programming languages.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Teaching Staff</h2> <p>Instructor: Prof. Chris Dellarocas</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Audience and Prerequisites</h2> <p>15.564 is an introductory course. It is assumed that students know how to use Macintosh or IBM PC word processors and spreadsheets. No knowledge of how computers work or are programmed is assumed. Students who have recently completed courses in computer architecture, operating systems, and telecommunications probably should not take this course, because most of the course consists of highlights of those topics. Student backgrounds vary considerably, however. Students with some background in electrical engineering or programming will breeze through certain topics, though it is hoped that the discussion of current eBusiness application classes as well as the term project (see the <a href=\"/courses/sloan-school-of-management/15-564-information-technology-i-spring-2003/assignments\">assignments</a> page) will benefit them as well. Those with no background will have to work harder, but mastery of this material is within reach of every MIT student regardless of background. Talk to the instructor if you're not sure whether your background is appropriate.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Logistics</h2> <p><a href=\"/courses/sloan-school-of-management/15-564-information-technology-i-spring-2003/lecture-notes\">Lectures</a>: Twice per week for 1.5 hours each.</p> <p><a href=\"/courses/sloan-school-of-management/15-564-information-technology-i-spring-2003/recitations\">Recitation</a>: Once per week for 1 hour. The purpose of recitation is to:</p> <blockquote> <p>a) review material covered in class during the week;<br /> b) provide additional examples and exercises that aid understanding;<br /> c) cover additional topics related to the material of the week.<br /> Due to the intense pace of this course, we strongly recommend that you try to attend as many recitations as possible!</p> </blockquote> <p>Other than office hours, the Professor may be contacted by appointment. Email is strongly encouraged!</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Readings, Lecture Notes and Textbooks</h2> <p>One of the unusual aspects of this course is the diversity of student objectives, backgrounds and previous exposure to the subject matter. To accommodate this diversity we propose that each student select his or her individualized sets of supplementary study materials from the list below. We will describe the recommended study materials and the strategy for choosing between them in the first session of the course. Please feel free to send us email if you have questions related to the best study materials for you. <em>Required materials</em></p> <p><a href=\"/courses/sloan-school-of-management/15-564-information-technology-i-spring-2003/lecture-notes\">Lecture notes</a> are preprints of Microsoft PowerPoint slides used by the instructor during lectures. They are fairly detailed and comprehensive (typically between 20-30 slides per lecture). In the past, most students found that the slides were the primary resource they used for reviewing the class material. Suggested study strategy: skim the lecture notes before class, then read carefully after class. We will be distributing lecture notes in class at the beginning of each lecture.</p> <p>Photocopied <a href=\"/courses/sloan-school-of-management/15-564-information-technology-i-spring-2003/readings\">readings</a> contain textbook chapters and magazine articles whose main purpose is to supplement the lecture notes and serve as a reference for the topics covered in class. Since this is a new course, we will be distributing readings in class as we go.</p> <p><em>Recommended materials</em></p> <p>There are two recommended textbooks:</p> <ul> <li><em>PriceWaterhouseCooper's Technology Forecast: 2002-2004,</em> Vol. 1: In addition to a concise technical introduction to the various topics covered, it provides excellent surveys of the marketplace, including pointers to leading vendors and products, as well as assessments of trends and directions. Our recommendation: Students with no previous exposure in IT might find this a bit heavy. On the other hand, students who have had some previous IT exposure and especially graduate students who are interested in connecting the technological principles we will learn in the lectures with the marketplace will find this an excellent reference. </li> <li>White, Ron et. al., <em>How Computers Work,</em> 6th ed., Que, 2001. Good introductory text on the internals of computer hardware and system software. Recommended if you don't have a background in science or engineering. Science and engineering majors might find this book too elementary. You may purchase this book from an online bookstore. </li> <li>The <a href=\"http://www.pcwebopedia.com\" target=\"_blank\">PC Webopedia</a> is a Web site that serves as an encyclopedia of Information Technology terms. It provides excellent explanations of Information Technology terms, together with links to additional web pages related to them. For each lecture, the course Web page contains pointers to the relevant category of the PC Webopedia. We strongly encourage you to use this valuable resource to clarify unanswered questions and to go beyond the material covered in class, according to your own personal interests.</li> </ul> <p>Finally, for students who would like to learn Microsoft Access in depth, the following is a recommended textbook (you may choose either):</p> <ul> <li>Viescas, John L., <em>Running Microsoft Access 2000,</em> Microsoft Press, 1999. One of the best and most detailed &quot;bibles&quot; on Microsoft Access. Coverage is way beyond what will be covered in this course. This is an excellent reference book for students who are interested in becoming Microsoft Access experts. If you are looking for something more concise, you may consider the Byrne textbook.</li> </ul> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Assignments, Exams, and Grading</h2> <p>The course <a href=\"/courses/sloan-school-of-management/15-564-information-technology-i-spring-2003/assignments\">assignments</a> consist of 5 problem sets, two in-class exams and a term project. Grades will be determined on the following basis:</p> <div class=\"maintabletemplate\"> <table class=\"tablewidth50\" summary=\"See table caption for summary.\"> <caption class=\"invisible\">Grading information.</caption> <thead align=\"left\"> <tr> <th scope=\"col\">ACTIVITY</th> <th scope=\"col\">PERCENTAGE</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody align=\"left\"> <tr class=\"row\"> <td>Problem Sets</td> <td>35%</td> </tr> <tr class=\"alt-row\"> <td>Midterm Exam</td> <td>20%</td> </tr> <tr class=\"row\"> <td>Final Exam</td> <td>20%</td> </tr> <tr class=\"alt-row\"> <td>Term Project</td> <td>20%</td> </tr> <tr class=\"row\"> <td>Class Contribution</td> <td>5%</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> </div> <br /> <p>Assignments are due in class during the <a href=\"/courses/sloan-school-of-management/15-564-information-technology-i-spring-2003/assignments\">due dates</a>. In special circumstances (e.g., illness, religious holidays) we'll try to be accommodating, if you make arrangements with us in advance. Late assignments will be penalized by 10% per 24 hours if you have not made arrangements in advance, and will not be accepted at all 48 hours after the time due.</p> <p>There are several ways to earn &quot;Class Contribution&quot; points. First and foremost is to come prepared for class, ask questions that other students want to know the answer to, and give clear, brief answers to questions I ask. Second is to locate magazine or newspaper articles that are relevant to the class and to bring a photocopy to me for distribution to the entire class. Third is to do follow-up research in order to answer an interesting question that comes up in class. In short, if you help other students learn, you get class contribution points.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Class Web Page</h2> <p>The 15.564 Web page will contain a wealth of information related to the course, such as the course syllabus, downloadable copies of the lecture notes, problem sets and various course-related announcements. For some sessions, it also provides links to additional (optional) reading material found on the Web. Our web page will be updated frequently during the term. You are required to join the class server and encouraged to visit it often!</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Computer Facilities</h2> <p>This is a course about Information Technology and several assignments require use of a PC. Students can use either their own PC or the facilities of the School Computer Center. If you do not have a lab account, we will provide one after the first week of classes. You are responsible for getting your own email account.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Collaboration Policy</h2> <p>You are encouraged to discuss material from the class with other students, including material related to problem sets. You must, however, write solutions independently. The time to stop collaborating is when you start writing. In addition, you must write on your problem sets and machine problems the name of anyone with whom you collaborated.</p> <p><strong>Do</strong>: discuss general concepts and techniques for performing the hands-on assignments; compare and discuss answers after you get the problem sets back.</p> <p><strong>Don't</strong>: copy or compare answers before you turn them in; debug each others' programs; sit together while you are writing up your solutions.</p> <p><strong>Consequences</strong>: If you copy or allow copying in violation of these rules, both parties get 0 on the entire assignment. If you do it again, you go to a discipline committee.</p> <p>Finally, it is strictly forbidden to consult and/or copy your answers from solution sets of past terms. Students who violate this rule will be asked to drop the class.</p> <p>If you're stuck on a particular problem and need help that would violate the collaboration policy, contact the TAs or the instructor. We'll help.</p> <div class=\"help slide-bottom\"> <div class=\"help-message\"> <a class=\"help-engage\" href=\"javascript: trackEvents('Bottom Get Started','bottom get started Click','Help Overlay');\">Need help getting started?</a> <a href=\"javascript:disableHelpPopup(); trackEvents('Bottom Don\\'t Show','bottom don\\'t show Click','Help Overlay');\" class=\"help-dismiss\">Don't show me this again</a> </div> </div> <div class=\"help popup-center\"> <div class=\"help-message\"> <p class=\"help-dismiss\"><a href=\"javascript:disableHelpPopup(); trackEvents('Popup Don\\'t Show','popup don\\'t show Click','Help Overlay');\">Don't show me this again</a></p> <h2>Welcome!</h2> <p>This is one of over 2,200 courses on OCW.

For many firms IT is the single largest capital investment, often exceeding 50% of capital expenditure. IT is an important vehicle for firms to achieve their business goals and has enabled radically lower cost structures, new levels of customer service, new products, and new markets. No longer can all the IT decisions be delegated to the IT professionals of the firm. New skills are now demanded of all managers including dealing with IT issues with confidence and competence. Managers are required to make complex IT investment decisions involving strategic, competitive, financial, and organizational choices.</p> <p>This course covers what every senior manager needs to know about using IT to enable strategy and get more value from IT. In this course we take the strategic perspective of the general manager and study how leading firms get more value from their IT investments via digitization of business processes. The course focuses on the strategic impact and business value that can be achieved rather than the details of the technology. Issues around governance and accountability will pervade the course. An IT background is not required and this is not a 'technical' course.</p> <p>In recent years there have been spectacular failures of large information technology (IT) investmentsâmajor enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems initiatives that were never completed, e-business initiatives that were ill-conceived or poorly executed and new systems that were never used effectively. In contrast, some firms use IT more effectively and get above industry average returns from their IT investments year after year. These successful firms not only make better IT decisions, they implement their decisions better.</p> <p>This is an integrative course including issues of business strategy, finance and the study of organizations and people covered in other parts of the MBA. The creation of business value requires the successful integration of these issues with the potential of IT. The course draws heavily on the research at the MIT Sloan Center for Information Systems Research and uses primarily Sloan developed case studies.</p> <p>The focus of the first part of the course is to understand how IT enables four fundamental business operating models. The implementation of these models are studied via a series of case studies including UPS, Merrill Lynch, 7-Eleven Japan, and Pacific Life as they strive for the optimal combination of business process integration and standardization.</p> <p>Then we will move to the pragmatic issues of ensuring business value covering topics including: IT decision making and governance, business architecture and change management, IT and business risk, and IT-driven business agility and innovation.</p> <p>We will explore these issues via lectures/discussions, case studies, guest speakers, group debates, and group presentations. Assessment will be based on contribution to class learning, group presentations, and a final report.</p> <p>The course aims to provide:</p> <ul> <li>A practical understanding of the strategic opportunities to create business value from IT</li> <li>A practical understanding of the way business value is created from IT, and the potential barriers</li> <li>A series of frameworks to help non-IT managers gain confidence in managing IT and its business impacts</li> <li>A set of case studies of how business value was or was not generated</li> <li>A forum to discuss the issues and learn from each other in a collegial way</li> </ul> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Course Goals</h2> <p>Students should:</p> <ul> <li>Be prepared, as general managers, to lead the firm in the appropriate use of information technology to achieve enterprise strategy;</li> <li>Understand from a business perspective how to generate business value from IT investments.</li> </ul> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Objectives</h2> <p>Students will:</p> <ul> <li>Understand how IT will shape future businesses and be prepared to contribute to enterprise architecture;</li> <li>Understand the risks and benefits of digitized processes and think strategically about whether to perform those processes internally or externally;</li> <li>Understand the impact of globalization and be prepared to lead change;</li> <li>Understand why some firms are better able to convert their IT investments into business value and identify steps to ensure effective IT decision making.</li> </ul> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Schedule and Preparation for Sessions</h2> <p>The schedule below contains the details of the course. This course has two main methods of learning, summarized as:</p> <h3 class=\"subsubhead\">Class Meetings and Case Studies</h3> <p>There are a few lecture/discussion sessions on the concepts. The other sessions are detailed case studies that require preparation and discussion in class.</p> <h3 class=\"subsubhead\">Group Assignments and Presentations</h3> <p>Each group of 3-5 students will prepare three presentations: (1) a justification for one side of a debate on a case study, (2) a recommendation for Colway Stores on its IT investment, (3) a project presentation. These three presentations will give you practice articulating the issues and making management presentations to simplify complex topics.</p> <p>To gain value from the cases it is important to come ready to discuss, argue, interpret, and give advice on the major issues. We will give everyone an opportunity to contribute to case discussions. To focus your reading and analysis a list of discussion questions for each case is provided.</p> <p>When preparing case studies, I suggest three steps:</p> <ol> <li>Read the discussion questions for the case.</li> <li>Read the case, check the company Web site, and analyze the firm's competitive positions and critical success factors. These concepts will be discussed in sessions 1 and 2.</li> <li>Prepare brief answers for each discussion question and take a position on the debate question.</li> </ol> <p>You are expected to have completed the additional readings for the class and to apply them, as appropriate to your case analysis.</p> <p>Readings are of two types.</p> <ol> <li>Cases that must <strong>all</strong> be carefully prepared.</li> <li>Readings that are to be read carefully to provide material for analyzing the cases or to introduce new concepts. Students are expected to reference these readings in class discussions.</li> </ol> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Text</h2> <p>Optional text (this book summarizes the research base for this courseâit is not required):</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1591398398/ref=nosim/mitopencourse-20\"><img alt=\"Buy at Amazon\" src=\"/images/a_logo_17.gif\" align=\"absMiddle\" border=\"0\" /></a> Ross, Jeanne, Peter Weill, and David Robertson. <em>Enterprise Architecture as Strategy: Creating a Foundation for Business Execution</em>. Boston, MA: Harvard Business School Press, 2006. ISBN: 9781591398394.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Assessment</h2> <p>The assessment of the course will have the following components:</p> <div class=\"maintabletemplate\"><table class=\"tablewidth50\" summary=\"See table caption for summary.\"> <caption class=\"invisible\">Assessment criteria.</caption> <thead align=\"left\"> <tr> <th scope=\"col\">ASSIGNMENTS</th> <th scope=\"col\">PERCENTAGES</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody align=\"left\"> <tr class=\"row\"> <td>Contribution to class learning</td> <td>40%</td> </tr> <tr class=\"alt-row\"> <td>Group presentation of case debate</td> <td>10%</td> </tr> <tr class=\"row\"> <td>Presentation and write-up of group project which applies concepts from this course to a specific firm</td> <td>40%</td> </tr> <tr class=\"alt-row\"> <td>Presentation and preparation on Colway case</td> <td>10%</td> </tr> </tbody> </table></div> <p> </p><h2 class=\"subhead\">Contribution to Class Learning</h2> <p>As an integrative course, with case studies and fieldwork, much of the learning is dependent on accessing the combined knowledge and experience of the group. It is everyone's job to keep the discussion productive and moving forward. In class discussions it is equally as important to talk about <strong>how</strong> to do something as <strong>what</strong> to do.</p> <p>Contributions don't all have to be original flashes of insightâbut they are very welcome! Class members who summarize, clarify, simplify, or suggest what else needs to be covered can also make a valuable contribution. If you are shy about contributing, prepare well and speak longer when you have the floor. If you are confident about speaking in public, focus on increasing the quality-to-airtime ratio of your contributions. Take some risks, but only after you have done the analysis and assessed the evidence.</p> <p>In evaluating your contribution to class learning the following are important.</p> <p>Positive characteristics are:</p> <ul> <li>Professional and ethical behavior at all times</li> <li>Good analysis supported by case facts or experience</li> <li>Relevance to previous contributions, i.e., the ability to listen</li> <li>Constructive disagreement</li> <li>Regard, respect and acknowledgment of other's contributions</li> <li>Good questions after group presentations</li> <li>Readiness to contribute upon receiving a &quot;cold call&quot;</li> </ul> <p>Negative contribution characteristics include:</p> <ul> <li>Arriving late to class</li> <li>Lack of involvementâsilence, detachment or disinterest</li> <li>Leading discussion into unrelated topics</li> <li>Spending undue amount of time on minor points</li> <li>Long, rambling comments</li> <li>Being absent or unprepared</li> </ul> <p>If you are concerned about your contribution to class learning please make an appointment to see the TA.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Group Work</h2> <p>Students will form groups of 3-5 people. Each group's primary concern is a project at the end of the term that applies the concepts from the course to a particular organization's business needs. We will offer connections to companies who sponsor the MIT Sloan Center for Information Systems Research or you may choose a firm with whom you already have contacts. Groups should be chosen and communicated to us by Ses #4. A one-paragraph description of the project and the name of the company you'll be working with are due by Ses #7. We will distribute specific requirements of the project in class and on the class Web page.</p> <div class=\"help slide-bottom\"> <div class=\"help-message\"> <a class=\"help-engage\" href=\"javascript: trackEvents('Bottom Get Started','bottom get started Click','Help Overlay');\">Need help getting started?</a> <a href=\"javascript:disableHelpPopup(); trackEvents('Bottom Don\\'t Show','bottom don\\'t show Click','Help Overlay');\" class=\"help-dismiss\">Don't show me this again</a> </div> </div> <div class=\"help popup-center\"> <div class=\"help-message\"> <p class=\"help-dismiss\"><a href=\"javascript:disableHelpPopup(); trackEvents('Popup Don\\'t Show','popup don\\'t show Click','Help Overlay');\">Don't show me this again</a></p> <h2>Welcome!</h2> <p>This is one of over 2,200 courses on OCW.

Dramatic changes in information technology and the nature of economic competition are forcing firms to come up with new ways of organizing work. This course uses economic theory to investigate the roles of information and technology in the existing diversity of organizations and markets and in enabling the creating of new organizational forms.</p> <p>The class is designed for Ph.D students in management, information technology, organizational behavior, industrial relations, economics, and related disciplines. For non-economists, this class offers an exposure to fundamental ideas in the economics of information, organizations, and markets. For economists, this class offers the opportunity to apply abstract economic ideas to the question of how the rise of information technology and related changes in the business environment affect organizations and markets. The applied nature of the class may also be appealing to MBA students willing to undertake the extensive reading assignments and class preparation required in a seminar class of this type.</p> <p>A seminar class works because students come prepared to engage in thoughtful discussions of the material. Students are therefore asked to write informal, two page memos prior to most classes. These memos will generally be responses to some questions or issues we pose prior to each class. Our purpose in assigning these memos is to help students reflect on important aspects raised in the assigned readings. In addition, each student will be asked to lead part of the class discussion. This will typically involve meeting with the instructor ahead of time to discuss objectives and discussion plans.</p> <p>There are no exams in this class but a final paper is due at the end of the semester. It can be either a survey of the research in a particular area or a research paper on a specific topic. Either way, the paper can be thought of as a step towards developing a research program. In the past, some of these papers have led to publications. Further details of the paper will be provided in class.</p> <div class=\"help slide-bottom\"> <div class=\"help-message\"> <a class=\"help-engage\" href=\"javascript: trackEvents('Bottom Get Started','bottom get started Click','Help Overlay');\">Need help getting started?</a> <a href=\"javascript:disableHelpPopup(); trackEvents('Bottom Don\\'t Show','bottom don\\'t show Click','Help Overlay');\" class=\"help-dismiss\">Don't show me this again</a> </div> </div> <div class=\"help popup-center\"> <div class=\"help-message\"> <p class=\"help-dismiss\"><a href=\"javascript:disableHelpPopup(); trackEvents('Popup Don\\'t Show','popup don\\'t show Click','Help Overlay');\">Don't show me this again</a></p> <h2>Welcome!</h2> <p>This is one of over 2,200 courses on OCW.

There is extensive attention to national and international intellectual property protection and strategies. Examples are drawn from many industries, including information technology, communications, and life sciences.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Some Advice from John Akula on Picking a Law Course</h2> <p>I offer the following three law courses at Sloan:</p> <ul> <li><a href=\"/courses/sloan-school-of-management/15-615-law-for-the-entrepreneur-and-manager-spring-2003/index.htm\">15.615</a> / <a href=\"/courses/sloan-school-of-management/15-615-law-for-the-entrepreneur-and-manager-spring-2003/index.htm\">15.647</a>, Law for the Entrepreneur and Manager (fall and spring) (615 is the full-semester course; 647 is the first half)</li> <li>15.616, Innovative Businesses and Breakthrough Technologies - The Legal Issues (fall only)</li> <li><a href=\"/courses/sloan-school-of-management/15-617-the-law-of-corporate-finance-and-financial-markets-spring-2004/index.htm\">15.617</a>, The Law of Corporate Finance and Financial Markets (spring only)</li> </ul> <p>Based on my experience as a practicing lawyer, I recommend that students at Sloan take a law course. Managers face many law-sensitive issues that are crucial to the welfare of their companies and their own careers. These issues often arise suddenly and outside the normal course of business. Each of my courses is designed to give you the understanding you will need to exercise good judgement and leadership in those situations. Each course will also provide you with the foundation in law that you will need to make effective use of legal advisors, and to develop later in your careers a more sophisticated understanding of any legal issues that are central to your particular responsibilities.</p> <p>However, I do not expect students to take more than one law course. Thus my courses are designed as an array of choices, not a sequence, and there is substantial overlap with respect to legal fundamentals. You should pick the one that interests you most.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Requirements</h2> <h3 class=\"subsubhead\">Class Attendance</h3> <p>Students should attend class, since material is covered that is not in the readings. Attendance is taken. Absences for good cause (such as job hunting or family obligations) are excused. You should e-mail the TA before or shortly after the class in question, with a &quot;cc&quot; to the instructor, to request an excused absence. You do not need to include any personal details with the request.</p> <h3 class=\"subsubhead\">Class Participation and &quot;On-deck&quot; Preparation</h3> <p>All students are expected to participate in class discussion. In addition, for each class, some students will be assigned in advance to be &quot;on-deck.&quot; &quot;On-deck&quot; students should make certain that they prepare with special care and are ready to respond to questions about the readings. Guest lecturers are invited to call on the on-deck students. Each student will be &quot;on-deck&quot; approximately three times.</p> <h3 class=\"subsubhead\">Take-home Exercises</h3> <p>There are two take-home exercises. Students have three hours for an exercise, and some choice as to the particular three-hour period. The exercises have been scheduled to be available during the periods shown on the <a href=\"/courses/sloan-school-of-management/15-616-innovative-businesses-and-breakthrough-technologies-the-legal-issues-fall-2004/assignments\">assignments</a> page. For each exercise, each student will make arrangements with the TA to receive the exam by e-mail at a mutually determined time during the availability period, and will e-mail back the completed exam within three hours of receiving it. The second exercise will cover only material not covered by the first.</p> <p>During the period the exercises are available, students may not consult any other person about the content of the course.</p> <p>The exercises heavily emphasize the required readings. The questions and format will be similar to previous years (although the exercises from some past years were of different lengths.) Past exercises and a sample answer will be made available to students.</p> <p>It is not expected that students will need the full three hours to complete the exercise. I use this format so that a student does not have to write fast to do well.

Managers face many law-sensitive issues that are crucial to the welfare of their companies and their own careers. These issues often arise suddenly and outside the normal course of business. Each of my courses is designed to give you the understanding you will need to exercise good judgement and leadership in those situations. Each course will also provide you with the foundation in law that you will need to make effective use of legal advisors, and to develop later in your careers a more sophisticated understanding of any legal issues that are central to your particular responsibilities.</p> <p>However, I do not expect students to take more than one law course. Thus my courses are designed as an array of choices, not a sequence, and there is substantial overlap with respect to legal fundamentals. You should pick the one that interests you most.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Requirements</h2> <h3 class=\"subsubhead\">Class Attendance</h3> <p>Students should attend class, since material is covered that is not in the readings. Attendance is taken. Absences for good cause (such as job hunting or family obligations) are excused. You should e-mail the TA before or shortly after the class in question, with a &quot;cc&quot; to the instructor, to request an excused absence. You do not need to include any personal details with the request.</p> <h3 class=\"subsubhead\">Class Participation and &quot;On-deck&quot; Preparation</h3> <p>All students are expected to participate in class discussion. In addition, for each class, some students will be assigned in advance to be &quot;on-deck.&quot; &quot;On-deck&quot; students should make certain that they prepare with special care and are ready to respond to questions about the readings. Guest lecturers are invited to call on the on-deck students. Each student will be &quot;on-deck&quot; approximately three times.</p> <h3 class=\"subsubhead\">Take-home Exercises</h3> <p>There are two take-home exercises. Students have three hours for an exercise, and some choice as to the particular three-hour period. The exercises have been scheduled to be available during the periods shown on the <a href=\"/courses/sloan-school-of-management/15-617-the-law-of-corporate-finance-and-financial-markets-spring-2004/assignments\">assignments</a> page. For each exercise, each student will make arrangements with the TA to receive the exam by e-mail at a mutually determined time during the availability period, and will e-mail back the completed exam within three hours of receiving it. The second exercise will cover only material not covered by the first.</p> <p>During the period the exercises are available, students may not consult any other person about the content of the course.</p> <p>The exercises heavily emphasize the required readings. The questions and format will be similar to previous years (although the exercises from some past years were of different lengths.) Past exercises and a sample answer will be made available to students.</p> <p>It is not expected that students will need the full three hours to complete the exercise. I use this format so that a student does not have to write fast to do well. This may be of special importance to students for whom English is a second language.</p> <h3 class=\"subsubhead\">Students Who Take More Than One of My Courses</h3> <p>If you take more than one of my courses, an additional research paper will be required in the second course, on a topic to be determined in discussions with the instructor.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Grading</h2> <p>Grading is not tied to a formula, but will be based approximately as shown below:</p> <div class=\"maintabletemplate\"> <table class=\"tablewidth50\" summary=\"table\"> <thead align=\"left\"> <tr class=\"tableheader\"> <th id=\"col1\" scope=\"col\">ACTIVITIES</th> <th id=\"col2\" scope=\"col\">PERCENTAGES</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody align=\"left\"> <tr class=\"row\"> <td headers=\"col1\">First Take-home Exercise</td> <td headers=\"col2\">30%</td> </tr> <tr class=\"alt-row\"> <td headers=\"col1\">Second Take-home Exercise</td> <td headers=\"col2\">40%</td> </tr> <tr class=\"row\"> <td headers=\"col1\">Class Attendance/Participation</td> <td headers=\"col2\">30%</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> </div><h2 class=\"subhead\">Textbook and Course Readers</h2> <p>Students should purchase: <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0324042914/ref=nosim/mitopencourse-20\"><img alt=\"Buy at Amazon\" src=\"/images/a_logo_17.gif\" align=\"absmiddle\" border=\"0\" /></a> Bagley, Constance E., and Craig E.

This course has two central themes: (1) How to think systematically and strategically about aspects of managing the organization's human assets, and (2) What really needs to be done to implement these policies and to achieve competitive advantage. </p> <p>This course will not get into the technical details of personnel management such as the psychometric aspects of test validation, the specifics of job evaluation methods, the mechanics of interviewing, or the intricacies of employment law. These topics are primarily relevant to those intending to be human resource professionals. Instead, this course adopts the perspective of a general manager and addresses human resource topics from a strategic perspective.</p> <p>Many managers and organizations recognize that a critical source of competitive advantage often comes not from having the most ingenious product design, the best marketing strategy, or the most state of the art production technology, but rather from having an effective system for obtaining, mobilizing, and managing the organization's human assets. A number of recent developments, including demographic changes in the labor force, the rapid pace of technological change, increased global competition, experiments with new organizational arrangements, and public policy attention to work force issues, are making human resource management topics increasingly important for all managers in organizations. Although many organizations recognize the importance of managing the work force effectively and even &quot;know&quot; what approaches are effective, it is remarkable how often firms and managers fail to implement these approaches.</p> <p>This course is designed to be integrative, drawing upon foundational material to which you have been exposed in core curriculum courses. Our orientation will be both analytical and managerial, focusing on the development of concepts and strategies that can increase your effectiveness in developing policies and practices that general managers can use to enhance the value of the people in their organizations.</p> <p>To integrate the conceptual and applied material the primary course material will be a series of cases illustrating both successes and failures. You will also be provided with supplementary readings and lectures that will supply concepts and frameworks. Each case will provide an opportunity to use the conceptual material in an analytic way. To help focus your analysis, a set of study questions for each case is included. These can be used to guide your case preparation.</p> <p>It is also important that we take advantage of the experience of class members. So, where relevant, please feel free to bring your own experiences and illustrations into class discussion. Throughout the course--virtually in every session--we will consider how what we are discussing differs across settings. Students with global experiences are especially encouraged to bring this knowledge into the classroom. The employment relationship in the U.S. is different in many respects from many other countries, so it is important that as managers we appreciate these differences in how human resources might be framed differently in other cultures. If we are to meet our goal of increasing your effectiveness in managing human resources, it is important to explore how, why, and under what circumstances various approaches work. Your previous experience, both positive and negative, is a valuable source of data for this learning.</p> <p>The course is divided into three sections. The first addresses the implementation of strategy and the importance of aligning human resource practices so that they are internally consistent and produce the skills and behaviors required to make the strategy work. The second section addresses a number of key HR levers available to managers in the development of an effective work system, including investing in people (training and development), participation and involvement (team-based systems), measurement and incentives (compensation), and information sharing. The third section of the course provides a summary and integration, illustrating how firms have succeeded or failed at tapping the potential of their work force.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Course Requirements</h2> <p>Class Participation: 40% of grade<br /> Case Write-ups: 20% of grade<br /> Quiz: 40% of grade</p> <h3 class=\"subsubhead\">Class Participation</h3> <p>Because this is a case-based class, each student is required to be an active participant in case discussions. Your participation grade will reflect my assessment of your total contribution to the learning environment. This includes not only the frequency of your contributions in class, but also their quality. Quality, includes, among other things: (1) sound, rigorous, and insightful diagnosis (e.g. sharpening of key issues, depth and relevance of analysis); (2) ability to draw on course materials and your own experience productively; (3) ability to advance or sharpen in-class discussion and debate, willingness to take risky or unpopular points of view, use of logic, precision, and evidence in making arguments; (4) professionalism of your conduct (attendance, punctuality, preparedness, and showing respect to all section members and their class contributions). Unexcused absences and lack of preparation will be counted heavily against your grade.</p> <h3 class=\"subsubhead\">Case Write-ups</h3> <p>Students are required to submit two written case analyses (no more than 5 pages long):</p> <ul> <li>Slade Plating Department</li> <li>Safelight Autoglass</li> </ul> <p>Case write-ups are due at the beginning of class - prior to the in-class discussion. Late write-ups will not be accepted.</p> <p>The write-ups will be evaluated according to how well you have demonstrated your mastery of the course material. This includes the application of appropriate conceptual materials; the effective use of evidence to develop your arguments; explicit assumptions and clear logical inferences; and a coherent and integrated analysis and assessment. The written work must be clear and well-organized. In addition, case write-ups should be typed, with reasonable fonts and margins.</p> <h3 class=\"subsubhead\">Quiz</h3> <p>On the final day of class you will have an opportunity to demonstrate your mastery of the course material through an in-class quiz. The quiz format will be short essays about topics that we have covered in the course.</p> <div class=\"help slide-bottom\"> <div class=\"help-message\"> <a class=\"help-engage\" href=\"javascript: trackEvents('Bottom Get Started','bottom get started Click','Help Overlay');\">Need help getting started?</a> <a href=\"javascript:disableHelpPopup(); trackEvents('Bottom Don\\'t Show','bottom don\\'t show Click','Help Overlay');\" class=\"help-dismiss\">Don't show me this again</a> </div> </div> <div class=\"help popup-center\"> <div class=\"help-message\"> <p class=\"help-dismiss\"><a href=\"javascript:disableHelpPopup(); trackEvents('Popup Don\\'t Show','popup don\\'t show Click','Help Overlay');\">Don't show me this again</a></p> <h2>Welcome!</h2> <p>This is one of over 2,200 courses on OCW.

In addition to the theory and exercises presented in class, students practice negotiating with role-playing simulations that cover a range of topics, including difficult situations such as cross-cultural mentoring and an emergency. Other special cases discussed include abrasiveness, dangerousness, racism, sexism, whistleblowing, and ethics. The course covers conflict management as a first party and as a third party: third-party skills include helping others deal directly with their conflicts, mediation, investigation, arbitration, and helping the system change as a result of a dispute.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Course Materials</h2> <p>Three books for the class are on reserve and at the campus bookstore â these textbooks are classics which may be useful for reference in the future. I assign all of Lewicki, and all of Ury. I assign brief sections of Moore. You can read Moore on reserve â or consider buying the book, if you will often be a &quot;third party&quot;.</p> <ul> <li>Lewicki, Roy J., David M. Saunders, and John W. Minton. <em>Essentials of Negotiation.</em> 2nd ed. Irwin, 2000. This is a new paperback â not the same text as last year.</li> <li>Moore, Christopher W. <em>The Mediation Process</em>. 2nd ed. Jossey-Bass, 1996.</li> <li>Ury, William. <em>Getting Past No: Negotiating with Difficult People.</em> Bantam, 1992.</li> <li>Other readings are on sale in the campus copy center, (15.667 Class Notes).</li> </ul> <p>If you are interested in &quot;speaking the same language&quot; as others who have had negotiations courses around the world, buy and read all of Roger Fisher and William Ury's little paperback, <em>Getting to Yes</em> (Arrow, 1991). (Ury has also just published a controversial paperback, <em>The Third Side: Why We Fight and How We Can Stop</em>. USA: Penguin, 2000.) If you are interested in the importance of social skills and negotiation skills to business success, buy or borrow Daniel Goleman's <em>Emotional Intelligence</em> (Bantam, 1997) â and read all of it when you can.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Course Expectations</h2> <p>The course is based on: readings, simulations and class discussions, four self-assessments, your analysis of the negotiations of others (known as Separate Pages), writing each week in your journal, and writing three Little Papers. There is no exam. 15.667 meets only eleven times â with a different topic each week â which is why I ask for a commitment that students come to all classes, barring health or family emergencies. (Students basically cannot do a &quot;make-up.&quot;) The course ends a week early. There is a double class for Session 11 with pizza and a guest speaker so the course can end early.</p> <p>Ethical expectations: Students are encouraged to work together with a classmate on any assignment. However, in preparing for a role, they may only work together with someone else who has the same role.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Grading</h2> <p>Grades are based 50% on class work and 50% on writing: your Little Papers, the journal and Separate Pages. Students should write in their confidential journals and write evaluations of their colleagues every week. I will read the papers, keep them confidential, and return them at the next class â <em>no one else sees them</em>.</p> <div class=\"help slide-bottom\"> <div class=\"help-message\"> <a class=\"help-engage\" href=\"javascript: trackEvents('Bottom Get Started','bottom get started Click','Help Overlay');\">Need help getting started?</a> <a href=\"javascript:disableHelpPopup(); trackEvents('Bottom Don\\'t Show','bottom don\\'t show Click','Help Overlay');\" class=\"help-dismiss\">Don't show me this again</a> </div> </div> <div class=\"help popup-center\"> <div class=\"help-message\"> <p class=\"help-dismiss\"><a href=\"javascript:disableHelpPopup(); trackEvents('Popup Don\\'t Show','popup don\\'t show Click','Help Overlay');\">Don't show me this again</a></p> <h2>Welcome!</h2> <p>This is one of over 2,200 courses on OCW.

We begin by tracing the historical development of theory and research in the field, paying special attention to how the normative premises, concepts, and methodological traditions of industrial relations compare to those of other disciplines that contribute to the study of work and employment relations. Then we will review a number of current theoretical and policy debates shaping the field. This will be followed by a series of modules introducing different disciplinary perspectives used to study work and employment issues today. Emphasis will be given to recent research from different industries that illustrate the mix of methodsâfield work, qualitative and quantitative data collection and analysis, etc.âwe encourage in this field of study.</p> <p>The seminar will be taught at MIT and broadcast simultaneously to five participating university IR/HR programs: Cornell, Illinois, Rutgers, Minnesota, and Michigan State. We will draw on faculty from these programs to lead discussions on topics that reflect their particular expertise. Other sessions will be led by faculty in the MIT Institute for Work &amp; Employment Research with expertise in these disciplines and topics. The course readings mix classical theoretical contributions with examples of current work within each discipline or perspective.</p> <p>We encourage participation in the seminar by PhD students from a variety of different departments and disciplines at MIT and other universities who share an interest in work and employment relations.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">MIT Participating Faculty</h2> <p>Thomas Kochan (Coordinator)<br /> Diane Burton<br /> Emilio Castilla<br /> Richard Locke<br /> Robert McKersie<br /> Michael Piore</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Tentative List of Topics</h2> <ul> <li>History of ideas in work and employment research</li> <li>Contemporary debates in the field and in policy</li> <li>Research traditions: institutional, multi-method, field based</li> <li>Pluralist traditions in industrial relations</li> <li>Marxist traditions in industrial relations</li> <li> <div>Neo-classical and institutional labor economics</div> </li> <li>Psychological and sociological foundations of work and human resource management</li> <li>Comparative politics, globalization, and employment relations</li> <li>Negotiations theory and research</li> <li>Strategic human resource management</li> </ul> <div class=\"help slide-bottom\"> <div class=\"help-message\"> <a class=\"help-engage\" href=\"javascript: trackEvents('Bottom Get Started','bottom get started Click','Help Overlay');\">Need help getting started?</a> <a href=\"javascript:disableHelpPopup(); trackEvents('Bottom Don\\'t Show','bottom don\\'t show Click','Help Overlay');\" class=\"help-dismiss\">Don't show me this again</a> </div> </div> <div class=\"help popup-center\"> <div class=\"help-message\"> <p class=\"help-dismiss\"><a href=\"javascript:disableHelpPopup(); trackEvents('Popup Don\\'t Show','popup don\\'t show Click','Help Overlay');\">Don't show me this again</a></p> <h2>Welcome!</h2> <p>This is one of over 2,200 courses on OCW.

Students perform original work crafting or enhancing a Roadmap in a technology-business domain of their choice. Thesis &amp; Special Project opportunities are offered &amp; encouraged. </p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Seminar Description</h2> <p>This seminar will explore the purposes and development of Technology Roadmaps for systematically mapping out possible development paths for various technological domains and the industries that build on them.</p> <p>Data of importance for such Roadmaps include rates of innovation, key bottlenecks, physical limitations, improvement trendlines, corporate intent, and value-chain and industry evolutionary paths.</p> <p>The course will build on ongoing work on the MIT Communications Technology Roadmap project, and begin exploring other domains as well. Towards this end, we will have faculty guest speakers â mostly lab directors drawn from a spectrum of research centers at MIT â each of whom will share their long-term perspective on their fields and what they perceive to be open and compelling directions for future effort.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Caveat</h2> <p>It's crucial that all participating students realize this is a <strong>Research</strong> Seminar, meaning that all participants must perform original (and hard) work. You should be doing this because you think this sort of in-depth research is highly aligned with your professional interests and aspirations. For example, research you will perform for this Seminar will be an excellent entrÃ©e to CTOs, key people in companies in your industry of choice, and so forth. We, in turn, will be offering sometimes half-baked &amp; even preliminary ideas, sharing lessons-learned along the way, figuring things out as we go, and generally investing a lot of time and braincycles into really understanding what Technology Roadmapping could and should be.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Seminar Goals</h2> <p>We hope to foster collaborative efforts between 1-3 students, MIT researchers, &amp; Industry Sponsors, cutting across MIT research areas. Furthermore, we hope this includes Cross Industry Benchmarking, ideally in partnership with Industrial Sponsors of current and potential research at MIT. We'd like to develop an &quot;MIT Method&quot; of Roadmapping which integrates Technology AND Business Dynamics. Ideally, we attract students passionate about the technology sector - however broadly or narrowly defined - who are committed to producing a coherent &amp; complete Tech Roadmap (Draft 1.0) during the Fall Semester. </p> <p>Our overall TRM aspiration is to build up a rich and thriving MIT Technology Roadmapping Initiative, one which integrates many currently disparate or fragmented research veins.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Elements of the MIT Technology Roadmapping Initiative</h2> <ul> <li> <strong>Business Cycle Dynamics</strong> - e.g. systems dynamics-like models of the bullwhip effect </li> <li> <strong>Industry Structure Dynamics</strong> - e.g. the double helix in <em>Clockspeed</em> </li> <li> <strong>Corporate Strategy Dynamics</strong> - e.g. S-curves &amp; dynamic analyses of players in the value chain </li> <li> <strong>Technology Dynamics</strong> - e.g. the Semiconductor Industry Association's roadmap built around Moore's law </li> <li> <strong>Regulatory Policy Dynamics</strong> - e.g. Cross-National, Cross-Sector </li> </ul> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Purpose of Roadmapping</h2> <p>Tech Roadmapping allows for a technology-and-Industry-level of observation &amp; analysis. Ideally the effort encourages Broad faculty participation, drawn from Multi-Disciplinary parts of the Institute, so as to cover the Emerging Technology spectrum and assessment of Business Implications of Technology trends. If done well, this offers a unifying, big-picture perspective, and a long-term &quot;futurecasting&quot; view. Furthermore, we are neutral-ground for discussion among industry players &amp; MIT research sponsors.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Possible Benefits of TRM</h2> <ul> <li> We closely observe Value Chain Evolution over time </li> <li> Language for discussion between business &amp; technology world </li> <li> Structured basis for interaction Cross Value Chains, between academia &amp; industry, spanning basic research through application </li> <li> Bridging between vertical &quot;silos&quot; of research - e.g. MicroPhotonics / LIDS / Media Lab / eBiz Center </li> <li> Publishing Collaborative Tech Roadmaps </li> <li> Risk goes down, Capital Investment goes up (generally) </li> </ul> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Technology Roadmapping Essentials</h2> <ul> <li> Performance indicators </li> <li> Innovations over time, trendlines </li> <li> Physical limitations </li> <li> Value Chains </li> <li> Industry Structure </li> </ul> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Examples of Degrees of Technology Aggregation</h2> <ul dir=\"ltr\"> <li> Communications Roadmap <ul> <li> Optical Communications <ul> <li> MicroPhotonics<br /> <br /> </li> </ul> </li> <li> Wireless <ul> <li> Personal Area Networking </li> <li> Cellular G3, G4, G5<br /> <br /> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> </li> <li> Medical Imaging <ul> <li> MRI <ul> <li> Functional MRI<br /> <br /> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> </li> <li> Nanotechnology <ul> <li> Precision Engineering <ul> <li> AFM<br /> <br /> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> </li> <li> Biological Engineering <ul> <li> Bacterial Robotic </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Enrollment &amp; Expectations</h2> <p>Open to truly dedicated students who commit to active attendance, the readings, the necessary independent research, &amp; crafting a high-quality Technology Roadmap in your technology domain of choice.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Grading</h2> <p>Students are graded 20% based on class participation &amp; attendance, 15% on progress report presentations &amp; documentation, 45% on the quality &amp; content of the final TRM presentation &amp; documentation, 5% for adding novel reference material to our library of links and TRM documentation, and 15% discretionary for demonstrably helping classmates improve their roadmapping abilities, sharing lessons-learned, and generally going &quot;above &amp; beyond.&quot; </p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Teamwork</h2> <p>We allow students to work either alone or in teams of 2 or 3 consisting of people of their own choice. For grading purposes, teamwork will be judged per-capita, with special effort made to assess individual contribution within the team. We will not tolerate free-riders in this seminar; everyone must be a full contributor.</p> <div class=\"help slide-bottom\"> <div class=\"help-message\"> <a class=\"help-engage\" href=\"javascript: trackEvents('Bottom Get Started','bottom get started Click','Help Overlay');\">Need help getting started?</a> <a href=\"javascript:disableHelpPopup(); trackEvents('Bottom Don\\'t Show','bottom don\\'t show Click','Help Overlay');\" class=\"help-dismiss\">Don't show me this again</a> </div> </div> <div class=\"help popup-center\"> <div class=\"help-message\"> <p class=\"help-dismiss\"><a href=\"javascript:disableHelpPopup(); trackEvents('Popup Don\\'t Show','popup don\\'t show Click','Help Overlay');\">Don't show me this again</a></p> <h2>Welcome!</h2> <p>This is one of over 2,200 courses on OCW.

Therefore, a major element of the course is a survey-based group project. It breaks down into seven tasks, which roughly coordinated with the seven weeks of the course:</p> <ol> <li>Selecting a topic and formulating a research plan</li> <li>Preparing for customer interviews</li> <li>Conducting and taping interviews</li> <li>Transcribing the interviews and identify customer statements or &quot;voices&quot;</li> <li>Interpreting or &quot;scrubbing&quot; the voices, and organizing into a hierarchy</li> <li>Proposing a new concept or solution based on the voices</li> <li>Writing the research report</li> </ol> <p>A typical problem involves understanding the customers' perspective in a new market.

Think of it as a comprehensive reference source, not as a textbook.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Software</h2> <p>The data analysis will be done with the JMP program. With respect to the software, there are three options:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Buy the complete JMP 5 package. The website for ordering and other info is: <a href=\"http://www.jmp.com/software/\">http://www.jmp.com/software/</a>.</p> <p>You can download a free demo version of JMP 5, which is disabled in some ways (you can't save files for example).</p> </li> <li> <p>Compromise alternative - there is a baby JMP (called JMP-IN). It has most (90%) of the data analysis capability that we use in this class, but it lacks two critical modules. The first one is &quot;cluster analysis&quot; which is a key tool for discovering segments in survey data; the second is &quot;design of experiments&quot; module, which will be important to those projects that do a 'conjoint analysis' exercise.</p> <p>More information on JMP-IN is available at: <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.jmp.com/\">http://www.jmp.com/</a>.</p> </li> <li> <p>If you are already familiar with a different package (e.g., SPSS, SYSTAT, SAS), feel free to use it (but make sure it has factor analysis and cluster analysis).</p> <p><strong>NOTE</strong>: Although we will distribute some notes indicating how to use the advanced features in JMP (for clustering and perceptual mapping), you will have to learn much of the basics of JMP on your own. We will schedule one session on JMP about half-way through the semester, but our advice is that you start exploring the software on your own right away.</p> </li> </ol> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Group Project (3-4 students per project)</h2> <p>This material is tough to learn from a textbook.

We will continue to look at added value and spend time identifying the resources of these firms.</p> <p>The fourth module, <strong>Challenging Competitive Advantage</strong>, looks at a number of situations where smaller firms challenge the advantages of more established competitors. We will look at the options of such challenges in light of the nature of the resources supporting their rivals. In the process we will spend time forecasting competitive dynamics.</p> <p>The final module, <strong>Creating Corporate Advantage</strong>, explores how the scope of firms are influenced by resources that are shared across products. In particular, we will look at cross selling, umbrella branding, and customer intelligence.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Pedagogical Structure</h2> <p>The course will consist of 5 lectures and 17 case discussions. In addition, each student should, as soon as possible, send a letter of complaint to a company.

Student teams work with managers to tackle the clients' most pressing issues. Students discuss experiences with their clients, and learn the modeling and consulting skills they need to be effective. Projects are sponsored by diverse organizations from a range of industries and sizes from start-ups to the Fortune 500. This course focuses on gaining practical insight from the system dynamics process, and appeals to people interested in system dynamics, consulting, or managerial policy-making.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Course Format</h2> <p>This project-based course meets for two 90-minute sessions each week. Prof. James Hines lectures in the first meeting of each week, while keeping the class highly interactive. In the other session, the class splits into two or three groups for &quot;break out sessions&quot; led by Prof. Hines or a teaching assistant. In each of these sessions, students give presentations to the group about the project work they've done the previous week.</p> <p>At the first class, students form groups of two to four members and are given a list of potential project topics. Each project is sponsored by a company or organization, who will act as the students' client throughout the semester. Once the topic is chosen, the teams follow the &quot;standard method&quot; in completing their projects, which is described step-by-step on the <a href=\"/courses/sloan-school-of-management/15-875-applications-of-system-dynamics-spring-2004/projects\">projects</a> page.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Textbook</h2> <p>Chapters are assigned weekly from the course textbook:</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/020134596X/ref=nosim/mitopencourse-20\"><img alt=\"Buy at Amazon\" src=\"/images/a_logo_17.gif\" align=\"absmiddle\" border=\"0\" /></a> Schein, Edgar H. <em>Process Consultation Revisited: Building the Helping Relationship</em>.

The emphasis throughout the course is on the development and application of conceptual models which clarify the interactions between competition, patterns of technological and market change, and the structure and development of organizational capabilities.</p> <p>This is not a course in how to manage product or process development. The main focus is on the acquisition of a set of powerful analytical tools which are critical for the development of a technology strategy as an integral part of business strategy. These tools can provide the framework for deciding which technologies to invest in, how to structure those investments and how to anticipate and respond to the behavior of competitors, suppliers, and customers. The course should be of particular interest to those interested in managing a business for which technology is likely to play a major role, and to those interested in consulting or venture capital.</p> <p>The course utilizes lectures, case analyses, simulations and independent reading. The readings are drawn from economics, and from research in technological change and organizational theory. The case studies provide an extensive opportunity to integrate and apply these abstract tools in a practical, business policy context.</p> <p>Grades will be determined by class participation, four two-page papers, and a final paper based on a group project. The group project â which may be written in groups of 3 people â consists of an in-depth exploration of technology strategy in an industry of your choice. Many students chose to focus their two page papers and final paper on the same topic and, thus, &quot;build up&quot; to the final paper due at the end of the semester. There is no final exam.</p> <p>This is an advanced course. I draw extensively on the material presented in 15.900, Strategic Management, and 15.011, Introduction to Economics. Knowledge or work experience of basic concepts in innovation and entrepreneurship in high technology settings is also useful for background to this course.</p> <p>As markets become more interdependent and dynamic, partnerships between firms have become a critical aspect of technology strategy. Therefore, another important theme of the course content is how high technology firms create, capture, and deliver value through inter-firm relationships such as alliances, collaborations, and joint ventures.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Grading</h2> <div class=\"maintabletemplate\"><table summary=\"See table caption for summary.\" class=\"tablewidth50\"> <caption class=\"invisible\">Grading criteria.</caption> <thead align=\"left\"> <tr> <th scope=\"col\">ACTIVITIES</th> <th scope=\"col\">PERCENTAGES</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody align=\"left\"> <tr class=\"row\"> <td>Class attendance and participation</td> <td>50%</td> </tr> <tr class=\"alt-row\"> <td>Four two-page papers</td> <td>30%</td> </tr> <tr class=\"row\"> <td>Final paper</td> <td>20%</td> </tr> </tbody> </table></div> <p> </p><h2 class=\"subhead\">Class Attendance and Participation</h2> <p>Most of your participation grade will be based on attending class on time and adding value during the case discussions.</p> <p>Of course, we understand that sometimes absences are necessary (e.g. sickness, interviews, etc.). Therefore, to give you a chance to make up the missed day's participation, we ask that you do the following: please write a 1 page memo either answering the questions (if it is a case day) or applying the frameworks in the lecture notes online to a company or industry of your choice. While making up absences with memos is optional, please do remember that participation is a big component of your grade. These memos should be handed to your TA before class the week after your absence. Also, we please ask that you let us know before a class absence if possible.</p> <p>Each student will also answer the main question for 3 different cases on the Course Blog (located on the class site). You may choose which of 3 questions you answer over the course of the term. We're looking for a few paragraphs to help us jumpstart discussion of the case. These answers are due by 11pm before the day of the case and will be publicly available for other students to comment upon in class.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Summary of Course Deliverables</h2> <p>Ses #3, 6, 10, and 16: Two-page papers</p> <p>Ses #14: Paragraph outlining final paper topic</p> <p>Ses #22: Presentation slides</p> <p>Ses #24: Final paper</p> <p>Over the course of the term: Three blog entries</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Collaboration</h2> <p>Group work is not only acceptable but actively encouraged. Indeed I would strongly recommend that you form a study group with a few friends who can meet to discuss the readings before each class. My experience suggests that this will significantly increase both your enjoyment of the course and the amount that you find yourself learning.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Supplementary Readings</h2> <p>Supplementary readings are used to illustrate key concepts in each section of the course. Some of these concepts may be familiar to those who have taken 15.350 / 15.351, Managing Technological Innovation and Entrepreneurship. If you have not taken either 15.350 or 15.351, and if you are otherwise unfamiliar with the following concepts:</p> <ul> <li>The S curve and the determinants of industry evolution</li> <li>Tools for exploring new markets: the nature of the innovator's dilemma</li> <li>Capturing value: uniqueness and complementary assets</li> <li>Core concepts in network externalities</li> <li>Why responding to discontinuous technological change is so difficult and what to do about it</li> </ul> <p>....then you may wish to read ahead in the papers listed in the <a href=\"/courses/sloan-school-of-management/15-912-technology-strategy-fall-2008/supplementary-readings\">supplemental readings</a> section.</p> <div class=\"help slide-bottom\"> <div class=\"help-message\"> <a class=\"help-engage\" href=\"javascript: trackEvents('Bottom Get Started','bottom get started Click','Help Overlay');\">Need help getting started?</a> <a href=\"javascript:disableHelpPopup(); trackEvents('Bottom Don\\'t Show','bottom don\\'t show Click','Help Overlay');\" class=\"help-dismiss\">Don't show me this again</a> </div> </div> <div class=\"help popup-center\"> <div class=\"help-message\"> <p class=\"help-dismiss\"><a href=\"javascript:disableHelpPopup(); trackEvents('Popup Don\\'t Show','popup don\\'t show Click','Help Overlay');\">Don't show me this again</a></p> <h2>Welcome!</h2> <p>This is one of over 2,200 courses on OCW.

In this unruly world, the sources of understanding and stability are often provisional and the ability to learn and to manage change is at a premium. The diversity of our society and work force contributes to conflicts over goals, interests, and frames of reference. These characteristics create an ongoing need for the ability to craft stable agreements that advance interests, build trust, and construct understanding in complex and unstable environments. They create a need for negotiation.</p> <p>To help you develop the understanding and skills necessary to respond to this challenge, we will explore three insights that currently shape negotiation research, theory, and practice. The insights each describe negotiation as an interactive process. The first insight is that even simple interdependencies create a dynamic environment in which multiple outcomes are possible. The bare fact that a bargain requires the consent of both parties is sufficient to open a complex space for interaction between negotiators. The second insight is that negotiation is rarely a zero-sum process. Negotiators affect not only how value is distributed, but also how much value there is to distribute. The third insight is that negotiation is a social process. Through their interactions, negotiators shape the terms in which they understand problems, their sense of what kind of behavior is fair, appropriate, and desirable, and their ability to trust.</p> <p>We treat these insights as providing a foundation for the study of negotiation and for negotiation practice, and the bulk of the term is devoted to exploring them. This inquiry is organized around three questions. We will begin the course by exploring situations in which interests are potentially in conflict. We examine how negotiators manage their interactions in strategic bargaining and ask, &quot;Why do we get one deal rather than another?&quot; We move on to situations where negotiations offer (or demand) an exploration of additional degrees of freedom and ask, &quot;How can we affect what's on the table?&quot; or, alternatively, &quot;How can we create value in a negotiation?&quot; In this section we will consider how negotiators create opportunities for mutual gains that make it possible to resolve negotiations that look intractable and to reach better outcomes where a deal is possible. Finally we turn to the question, &quot;How can we shape the game we play?&quot; Here we take a micro-view of negotiations to analyze how negotiators draw on and shape expectations and roles, build understanding (and misunderstanding), and construct relationships in which trust and cooperation are (at least sometimes) possible in their interactions. We will conclude the term by examining the ways in which introducing history, adding parties, negotiating at multiple levels, and acting in an organizational context influence negotiation practice.</p> <p>By exploring these questions, we hope to accomplish two goals. First, we hope that you will develop skills that will make you a better negotiator. Second, we hope to help you connect your developing understanding of negotiation to adjacent questions about learning, rationality, ethics, organizational behavior, and other fields. In more substantive terms, this course should help you to diagnose conflict, prepare to negotiate, negotiate purposefully and thoughtfully, and critically evaluate outcomes and experiences.</p> <p>We will examine a variety of contexts and problems that create a need for negotiation, and raise questions about what it means to negotiate well. We will explore a systematic approach to negotiation that we think constitutes good advice about what to do when your interests or beliefs are in tension with others' and you cannot act unilaterally. We will also raise other issues that will situate this model in a broader field of intellectual inquiry.</p> <p>You will have the opportunity to experiment with this approach and to try out alternative approaches in negotiation exercises and case analyses. These exercises form the core of the course. We will use them to examine concepts and analytic approaches. You will also find that the value of these negotiations sometimes exceeds our ability to provide an account. This means that the opportunity is always open to extend our understanding of negotiation. It challenges us individually, and as a group, to provide as clear an account as we can of our experience, to listen carefully, and to reflect critically on our experience. This suggests that you can think about the course as a research seminar, in which the common experience of negotiating with each other provides the substantive basis for our analysis. At the same time, you should expect to finish the course as a more effective negotiator.</p> <p>At a general level, we will move from negotiations that involve fewer factors to ones that are more complex. By the end of the course, however, we hope that you will appreciate the layered complexity that was involved in what at first appeared to be simple negotiations.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Readings</h2> <p>One book and one set of role simulation exercises are required.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0140157352/ref=nosim/mitopencourse-20\"><img alt=\"Buy at Amazon\" src=\"/images/a_logo_17.gif\" align=\"absmiddle\" border=\"0\" /></a> Fisher, Roger, W.

The overarching goal of this class is to make sure that each and every student is comfortable and skilled at using quantitative information and sound reasoning to address the problems and questions they encounter in planning, design, and policy-making contexts. As with your other classes, students are expected to approach this course with the characteristic blend of ambition and skepticism that defines the Department of Urban Studies and Planning approach to planning: that is, we expect you to be energetic and creative in your application of the skills you will learn in quantitative reasoning, statistical methods, and the presentation and visualization of complex information, but also to be critical of these methods where appropriate, questioning whether the Modern Age's confidence in statisticsâthe prevailing faith in &quot;hard numbers,&quot; &quot;scientific accuracy,&quot; and &quot;dispassionate logic&quot;âmay at times be overstated or unjustified.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">A Few Thoughts on <em>Quantitative</em> and <em>Qualitative</em> Methods</h2> <p>Much is made of the distinction between quantitative and qualitative approaches. Fortunately, planning is a field where you will be able (and expected) to master both, so we don't need to waste a lot of space here with rhetorical debates about which is &quot;truer,&quot; or better, or more persuasive. But for the time being, for this class, we need to concentrate on the quantitative aspects of the field (hence the &quot;Q&quot; in this particular &quot;QR&quot;); we will be concerned with things that can be measured, compared, and analyzed with regard to scale, size, variation, frequency and distribution, degree, and proportion. We will also be concentrating on the differences between observed samples and entire populations, and using statistical tools to distinguish between meaningful differences and random noise. That said, it may be worth meditating on the possibility that from an existential perspective, things in the world are not really either quantitative or qualitativeâthese words refer to ways we <em>approach</em> these things (or events, phenomena, ideasâwhatever). To use a hackneyed old example, consider a tree in the forest: it is neither quantitative nor qualitativeâit is just there, being tree-ey. These aspects of the tree only come out in relation (or perhaps in reaction) to our observation and discussion of it: &quot;how tall is it?&quot; &quot;how old?&quot; &quot;is it healthy?&quot; &quot;is it pretty?&quot; &quot;what's it good for?&quot; Depending on how we want to answer these questions, we may choose more quantitative or more qualitative methods. Interestingly, which approach will be more helpful for which questions is not always obvious.</p> <p>Most of the implications of this line of thinking are far beyond our purposes here, but it does help to point to the artificiality of the distinction, and may help us see these two types of approaches more as a continuum and less as two unreconcilable world views.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Putting the &quot;R&quot; Back in &quot;QR&quot;</h2> <p>The second half of &quot;QR&quot; stands for &quot;Reasoning.&quot; As you begin to prepare your mind for the course, please remember that this is not just a statistics course. The quantitative partâdealing with gathering, analysis, and presentation of numbersâis certainly a key aspect of the class. But equally important will be developing skills in <em>reasoning</em>: making and critiquing arguments; stating and investigating hypotheses; avoiding bias in your own work and identifying it in the work of other challenges that have more to do with logic and clear-thinking than with numbers and data <em>per se</em>.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">A Note About Knowledge and Belief</h2> <p>In the first few weeks of the class, we will touch on the difference between knowledge and belief: a belief may be true, but only when it is justified and explained can one be said to possess true knowledge. Importantly, the need to insist upon this higher standard is all the more crucial when we are working to develop knowledge of tools (such as logic, quantitative reasoning, research design, and statistical methods), as these can then form a foundation to build further (justified and explained) knowledge; if the foundations are shaky, you will never be able to trust the upper floors.</p> <p>I would like to challenge all of you to develop actual knowledge concerning the material we coverâthat is, to learn the methods that we think work for this or that purpose and to understand why we use them. Not everyone agrees with this level of intellectual rigor, and to be honest, others may be right: it might be a waste of your time, and you can probably get by fine in planning or even academic research by just treating quantitative methods as a series of recipes to use as dictated by the textbooks and other experts. (Of course, it is extremely difficult for an outside observer to know the difference between the two, as rote memorization of facts and blind acceptance of the formulas in the text will still get you the right answers; therefore, whether you choose to pursue true knowledge or just faith in the experts is largely up to you...)</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">A Sappy Comment to Inspire You</h2> <p>Finally, I should mention that in addition to being useful towards meeting your professional goals, Quantitative Reasoning is also very fun, and can be meaningful from a philosophical perspective. We'll talk about this a little in class, and I hope you find yourself inspired you see the beauty and wonder in it all.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Requirements</h2> <p>You need to:</p> <ol type=\"a\"> <li>read all the reading assignments</li> <li>complete all the written assignments and problems assigned</li> <li>attend all the classes and participate in the discussions</li> <li>pass the exam</li> <li>otherwise think about, remember, and learn all the material</li> </ol> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Grading</h2> <p>Your grade for the class will be based on the following allocation:</p> <div class=\"maintabletemplate\"><table class=\"tablewidth50\" summary=\"See table caption for summary.\"> <caption class=\"invisible\">Grading criteria.</caption> <thead align=\"left\"> <tr> <th scope=\"col\">COMPONENTS</th> <th scope=\"col\">PERCENTAGES</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody align=\"left\"> <tr class=\"row\"> <td>Participation (lectures, sections, and timely preparation of readings and problems)</td> <td>25%</td> </tr> <tr class=\"alt-row\"> <td>Midterm exam</td> <td>15%</td> </tr> <tr class=\"row\"> <td>Written assignment 1</td> <td>15%</td> </tr> <tr class=\"alt-row\"> <td>Written assignment 2</td> <td>15%</td> </tr> <tr class=\"row\"> <td>Written assignment 3</td> <td>30%</td> </tr> </tbody> </table></div> <p> </p><h2 class=\"subhead\">Lectures</h2> <p>Although it should go without saying, you are expected to attend lectures. Beyond this, you are expected to <em>participate</em>. Rarely (I hope never) will the entire hour-and-a-half be spent as a lectureâwe will have a group discussion, pursue interesting or meaningful sidetracks, listen to guest speakers and student presentations, and even occasionally play games.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Recitation Sections</h2> <p>In addition to the two &quot;lectures&quot; each week, the course includes a one-hour weekly recitation session. These are mandatory (and your active participation will be even more essential in these smaller groups). Some weeks will be spent in review, especially as we get closer to the exams or when we are dealing with the more computational material; other weeks will be more discussion-oriented, as we drill down into closer readings of particular studies of articles.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Lab Sections</h2> <p>Four times throughout the semester you will have lab sections instead of recitation sections. This will give you the opportunity to become familiar with a statistical software package (either <a href=\"/courses/urban-studies-and-planning/11-220-quantitative-reasoning-statistical-methods-for-planners-i-spring-2009/labs#stata\">Stata</a> or <a href=\"/courses/urban-studies-and-planning/11-220-quantitative-reasoning-statistical-methods-for-planners-i-spring-2009/labs#r\">R</a>). We will use software to explore concepts and methods we covered in class a week or two earlier so you will already be familiar with the basics (and hopefully the introduction of the computers will illuminate your grasp of the fundamentals).</p> <div class=\"help slide-bottom\"> <div class=\"help-message\"> <a class=\"help-engage\" href=\"javascript: trackEvents('Bottom Get Started','bottom get started Click','Help Overlay');\">Need help getting started?</a> <a href=\"javascript:disableHelpPopup(); trackEvents('Bottom Don\\'t Show','bottom don\\'t show Click','Help Overlay');\" class=\"help-dismiss\">Don't show me this again</a> </div> </div> <div class=\"help popup-center\"> <div class=\"help-message\"> <p class=\"help-dismiss\"><a href=\"javascript:disableHelpPopup(); trackEvents('Popup Don\\'t Show','popup don\\'t show Click','Help Overlay');\">Don't show me this again</a></p> <h2>Welcome!</h2> <p>This is one of over 2,200 courses on OCW.

What does it mean to make an argument? What are the different types and styles of arguments that you can make? What are the different forms of writing that you need to learn in order to be successful here at MIT and when you move into the professional world?</p> <p>This seminar provides the forum we will use to discuss your ideas, thoughts, apprehensions, frustrations and successes that go along with writing and communicating effectively. In this class we will write, revise and revise again. We will also practice oral briefing skills.</p> <p>This class uses some of the assignments in your other classes as a springboard for the writing that we will be doing in this class. This means that I do not intend to make up all the writing for you to complete. Instead, I encourage you to use assignments from your other classes (such as the Gateway class, <a href=\"/courses/urban-studies-and-planning/11-201-gateway-planning-action-fall-2005/index.htm\">11.201</a>) to analyze, revise and rethink your arguments about topics that interest you.</p> <p>Here are just a few of the topics we will discuss:</p> <ul> <li>Understanding the parts of an argument</li> <li>Drafting memos that get results</li> <li>Creating and giving oral briefings</li> <li>Understanding good, bad and horrible graphics</li> </ul> <p>As part of this class, you will be given many opportunities to practice your writing and speaking skills. In-class writing and peer review will provide the means by which you practice and refine your ability to communicate complex ideas clearly.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Collaborative Learning</h2> <p>This class works best for those students who use class time to share their ideas, thoughts and creative suggestions. This means practicing active listening and participating skills. You will find that giving and receiving constructive feedback can be a highly useful tool for learning to analyze and improve the quality of your writing and analysis. Your peers can provide a new perspective, valuable insights, and guidance for you as you work through your research question.</p> <p>Toward this end, we will work together to test your writing in order to help you find ideas that can be structured into viable arguments. As in many group situations, those students who commit to coming to each class and who are more willing to put forward nascent ideas and thoughts will get the most time and assistance.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Grading</h2> <p>The Grade for the course is based on a series of written and oral assignments.</p> <div class=\"maintabletemplate\"> <table class=\"tablewidth50\" summary=\"See table caption for summary.\"> <caption class=\"invisible\">Grading criteria.</caption> <thead align=\"left\"> <tr> <th scope=\"col\">ACTIVITIES</th> <th scope=\"col\">PERCENTAGES</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody align=\"left\"> <tr class=\"row\"> <td>Attendance</td> <td>25%</td> </tr> <tr class=\"alt-row\"> <td>Short Assignments</td> <td>50%</td> </tr> <tr class=\"row\"> <td>Oral Presentations</td> <td>25%</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> </div> <br /> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Attendance</h2> <p>As indicated above, attendance is critical to a class forum which will largely be a round-table (although we have a rectangular table) discussion. We will use the time together to discuss ideas, review writing and presentation work and explore the next steps in the research process. As such, students will be allowed <strong>only two unexcused absences</strong> from class.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Written Work</h2> <p>All written assignments must be submitted in hard copy on the day it is due (this includes PowerPoint<sup>Â®</sup> presentations). Written work must be typed, spell-checked, and neatly formatted. Please include your name, the course number, assignment number, and date at the top of the page or on a cover sheet. While an occasional typo or editing error may slip through, the presence of several mistakes indicates a lack of attention and will lower your grade. Specific formatting conventions are negotiable, based on standards in your field and appropriateness for your intended audience. <strong>All work must be professional looking and designed for easy reading</strong>.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Documenting Sources</h2> <p>Do not cut and paste material from Web pages or other documents without making evident the source of the information. This is called plagiarism, which is a serious offense and subject to formal action by the Institute. Inadequately documented papers (including bibliography and footnotes or in-text citations) will not receive a passing grade. <strong>When in doubt, document the source</strong>.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Weekly Workshops</h2> <p>The focus of this class will be on editing and revising. So, each week we will review writing that you or I bring to share with the class. You will take turns bringing in writing to share with the class so that we get a chance to really focus on what you have brought. Student samples should be no more than one page long.</p> <p>How this works: I will assign each of you two dates for which you will be expected to bring in writing to share with the class. This is your chance to get substantial feedback on the areas that you need to work in. So, I encourage you to select your pieces of writing carefully in order to get the most out of the workshop session.</p> <p>We will work in small groups and together as a larger class. Please bring in an electronic copy and also 10 copies of each piece of writing on your assigned day.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Weekly Readings</h2> <p>In order to be able to write arguments, you need to read well-written published arguments. So, each week you should be reading 5 to 10 opinion/editorial pieces.</p> <div class=\"help slide-bottom\"> <div class=\"help-message\"> <a class=\"help-engage\" href=\"javascript: trackEvents('Bottom Get Started','bottom get started Click','Help Overlay');\">Need help getting started?</a> <a href=\"javascript:disableHelpPopup(); trackEvents('Bottom Don\\'t Show','bottom don\\'t show Click','Help Overlay');\" class=\"help-dismiss\">Don't show me this again</a> </div> </div> <div class=\"help popup-center\"> <div class=\"help-message\"> <p class=\"help-dismiss\"><a href=\"javascript:disableHelpPopup(); trackEvents('Popup Don\\'t Show','popup don\\'t show Click','Help Overlay');\">Don't show me this again</a></p> <h2>Welcome!</h2> <p>This is one of over 2,200 courses on OCW.

The emphasis is on the logic of the research process and its constituent elements. The course relies on a seminar format so students are expected to read all of the assigned materials and come to class prepared to discuss key themes, ideas, and controversies. Since the materials draw broadly on the social sciences, and since students have diverse interests and methodological preferences, ongoing themes in our discussions will be linking concepts to planning scholarship in general and considering how different epistemological orientations and methodological techniques map on to planning specializations.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Course Meeting Times</h2> <p>Lectures:1 session / week, 3 hours / session</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Participation</h2> <p>This seminar requires active participation in discussions and critical reflection and assessment of the course material. While quantity matters, this portion of your grade ultimately will be based on the quality of your participation. Therefore, you should be prepared to discuss the main points of the readings, ask questions, provide constructive feedback, and generate and share critical perspectives. Some weeks I may ask you in advance to read and summarize a particular article. Other weeks I will randomly call on you to summarize the main arguments of articles and to answer questions. Your performance in these assignments and discussions will be the factors that determine your participation grade.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Grading</h2> <div class=\"maintabletemplate\"> <table class=\"tablewidth50\" summary=\"See table caption for summary.\"> <caption class=\"invisible\">Grading criteria.</caption> <thead align=\"left\"> <tr> <th scope=\"col\">ACTIVITIES</th> <th scope=\"col\">PERCENTAGES</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody align=\"left\"> <tr class=\"row\"> <td>CNC I</td> <td>5%</td> </tr> <tr class=\"alt-row\"> <td>CNC II</td> <td>10%</td> </tr> <tr class=\"row\"> <td>CNC III</td> <td>5%</td> </tr> <tr class=\"alt-row\"> <td>CNC IV</td> <td>5%</td> </tr> <tr class=\"row\"> <td>LG I</td> <td>10%</td> </tr> <tr class=\"alt-row\"> <td>LG II Survey</td> <td>5%</td> </tr> <tr class=\"row\"> <td>LG III Interview</td> <td>5%</td> </tr> <tr class=\"alt-row\"> <td>LG IV Draft</td> <td>10%</td> </tr> <tr class=\"row\"> <td>LG V Final</td> <td>20%</td> </tr> <tr class=\"alt-row\"> <td>Participation</td> <td>25%</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> </div> <br /> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Ways to Fail 11.233</h2> <h3 class=\"subsubhead\">Miss Class Sessions</h3> <p>While it may seem obvious, you are required to attend all class sessions. If you miss more than one session during the semester you will receive a zero for your final participation grade.</p> <h3 class=\"subsubhead\">Arrive Late, Leave Early</h3> <p>If you arrive late or leave early, you will receive a zero for participation for the day. If you arrive late or leave early more than two times, you will receive a zero for your final participation grade.</p> <h3 class=\"subsubhead\">Submit Work Late or Not at all</h3> <p>In general, late submissions of all CNC and LG assignments will not be accepted. You will receive a zero for any assignment not turned in on time. Exceptions will be made in extraordinary circumstances, but only with written approval from the instructor prior to the submission date. If you are granted an extension for any of the assignments and you receive an incomplete for the semester, you will have until noon on 15 January to submit all outstanding work (by email). Work not received by that time will receive a zero/no credit and will be used in computing your final grade for the course.</p> <h3 class=\"subsubhead\">Submit Poorly Written Work</h3> <p>If your work is not written in proper English or contains more than the rare typo it will be returned unread with a grade of zero/no credit. If you have difficulty writing in proper English, you should seek assistance at the MIT Writing and Communication Center. When the instructor or TA suggests you visit the writing center, you should do so. Taking offense and digging in your heels, as opposed to recognizing that we are trying to help you, will only result in your receiving your work returned unread in the future. As a rule of thumb, you should get in the habit of having your graduate student colleagues review and comment on your work before making a submission.</p> <h3 class=\"subsubhead\">Exceed Specified Length for Written Work</h3> <p>If you are able to complete a first rate assignment in less space than is allocated, you are welcome to do so. However, if your work is longer than the specified length, or it meets the length limit only because you manipulated the fonts and/or margins, you will receive a zero/no credit.</p> <div class=\"help slide-bottom\"> <div class=\"help-message\"> <a class=\"help-engage\" href=\"javascript: trackEvents('Bottom Get Started','bottom get started Click','Help Overlay');\">Need help getting started?</a> <a href=\"javascript:disableHelpPopup(); trackEvents('Bottom Don\\'t Show','bottom don\\'t show Click','Help Overlay');\" class=\"help-dismiss\">Don't show me this again</a> </div> </div> <div class=\"help popup-center\"> <div class=\"help-message\"> <p class=\"help-dismiss\"><a href=\"javascript:disableHelpPopup(); trackEvents('Popup Don\\'t Show','popup don\\'t show Click','Help Overlay');\">Don't show me this again</a></p> <h2>Welcome!</h2> <p>This is one of over 2,200 courses on OCW.

This is true in democracies around the world. Planners, policy-makers, developers, and advocates of the poor, concerned about the fairness, efficiency, stability, and wisdom of public sector decision-making, are constantly searching for better ways of resolving conflicts. Recent advances in the theory and practice of consensus building and dispute resolution are, therefore, of great significance.</p> <p>This seminar is designed for graduate students with no prior background or experience in the fields of negotiation or dispute resolution. Lectures, case studies, and simulations are used to introduce students to the &quot;art&quot; and &quot;science&quot; of negotiation and conflict management. The class also provides an intensive opportunity to build individual negotiating skills. Occasional guest lectures by well-known practitioners provide an opportunity for students to test some of the theoretical ideas presented in class against the issues that arise in practice.</p> <p>Some of the most important work in the field of dispute resolution is being done at the inter-university Program on Negotiation at Harvard Law School (PON). The Department of Urban Studies and Planning is well represented at the Program through the work of students and faculty affiliated with the MIT-Harvard Public Disputes Program. We try to build on the last two decades of research at PON.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Assignments and Requirements</h2> <p>No term paper is required. There will be a mid-term exercise and an in-class final. Every student is expected to submit bi-weekly journal entries commenting on the assigned readings and responding to questions presented throughout the semester. Participation in all weekly simulations is required. There will be an in-class final exam.</p> <p>Copies of the course reader will be available to enrolled students for purchase during the first week of the term.</p> <p>Enrollment is limited. Preference will be given to DUSP students. The graduate instructor will be available weekly to meet with students during scheduled office hours. In addition, if you would like to set up a time to see Professor Susskind, please sign up during his posted office hours.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Books to Purchase</h2> <p><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0140157352/ref=nosim/mitopencourse-20\"><img alt=\"Buy at Amazon\" src=\"/images/a_logo_17.gif\" align=\"absmiddle\" border=\"0\" /></a> Fisher, Roger, and William Ury. <em>Getting to Yes</em>. 2nd ed.

During the semester, we will examine the claims made by groups and the policy and civil society responses that have been used to address perceived inequity and injustice. While most of the course will focus on the United States, some attention will be given to international issues and perspectives. This course requires active participation in discussions and critical assessments of the implications of environmental in/justice from both theoretical and practical standpoints.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Grading Criteria and Assignments</h2> <ol> <li>Class Participation: This course requires your full participation in each session. Most weeks everyone will read the same articles. However, some weeks you will select an additional article or two to read and summarize for the class. You should be prepared to provide summaries of the readings, ask questions, provide constructive feedback, assist classmates locate resources, and generate and share critical perspectives.<br /> <br /> </li> <li>Reaction Papers: You are required to write brief (no more than one-page) reaction papers on the readings each week. These papers should include a statement of what you believe are the most important aspects of the readings as well as your reactions, critiques, disagreements, and / or questions. Reaction papers will not be graded, but they will be counted toward your final grade.<br /> <br /> </li> <li>Term Project: Your project should focus on a topic related to environmental justice that is of personal interest. For instance, you can study the EJ campaigns of one or more environmental organizations, volunteer to work on an EJ related activity, analyze the distribution of sitings in a given locale, or do primary or secondary research on any topic related to EJ. Students who prefer to write two short papers or to submit their paper in installments are welcome to pursue these options. There are four requirements and deadlines related to the project:</li> </ol> <div style=\"MARGIN-LEFT: 2em\"> <ul> <li>Meet with the professor at least once during the semester to discuss your topic and plans for the term project, paper, and presentation.<br /> <br /> </li> <li>Write a one paragraph summary of your topic.<br /> <br /> </li> <li>Complete your final paper (details of the paper will be discussed) by Lecture 11.<br /> <br /> </li> <li>Present your project to the class.

A way of framing neighborhood institutions and organizations, their relationship to one another and to citywide players is a theme running throughout the course.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Course Objectives</h2> <p>As an introduction to the field of HCED, the course is structured to:</p> <ol> <li>advance students' understanding of how public policy and private markets affect housing, economic development, the local economy, and neighborhood institutions;<br /> <br /> </li> <li>provide an overview of techniques for framing public and private interventions to meet housing and community development agendas (broadly defined) of inner-city and low-income neighborhoods;<br /> <br /> </li> <li>review and critique specific programs, policies and strategies that are (and have been) directed at local development and neighborhood regeneration issues; and<br /> <br /> </li> <li>give students an opportunity to reflect on their personal sense of the &quot;housing, community, and economic development&quot; process and the various roles that planners play in implementing various elements of those processes.</li> </ol> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Readings</h2> <p>There is a substantial amount of reading for this course. Students are expected to attend class having read and digested the readings, and to be prepared to engage in intense discussion of them.

After an introduction to the role of financing in the economic development process, the course provides a foundation in how firms and development projects are financed and the interpretation and analysis of business financial statements to understand capital needs and evaluate the ability to support financing. The third part considers how capital market imperfections result in financing gaps and focuses on the policy and institutional models that exist to address these capital gaps and stimulate private investment in community and economic development. Program management is the focus of the fourth part of the course where issues of program design, operations and capitalization will be reviewed. Finally, students will be introduced to public finance tools and their application to economic development.</p><p>The course objective is to provide students with a comprehensive overview of economic development finance practice in the United States and develop a knowledge base and skills to either be a development finance practitioners or apply economic development finance approaches to other fields of planning and community development. Students can expect to gain the following knowledge and skills from the course:</p><ol><li>An understanding of the operation of private financial markets and their limitations in serving economic development finance needs.</li><li>Familiarity with the program models and institutions that can be used to address community and business finance gaps.</li><li>An understanding of different business capital needs and the appropriate financial instruments and institutions used to address these needs.</li><li>An introduction to interpreting and analyzing business financial statements.</li><li>Tools to evaluate and structure financing plans for firms and real estate projects.</li><li>Knowledge of federal economic development financing programs.</li><li>An understanding of operational needs and best practices in managing economic development finance programs.</li><li>The ability to match feasible program approaches and models to address specific development financing gaps and business capital needs.</li><li>The capacity to identify institutional and program resources that can be used to meet economic development financing objectives.</li><li>An introduction to public finance tools and their economic development uses.</li></ol><h2 class=\"subhead\">Reading Materials and Assignments</h2><p>Reading assignments are specified for each class. Optional readings are listed for some classes and students are encouraged to read or skim these materials as well. Reading assignments are primarily from the course textbook with occasional supplementary readings.</p><p>Many classes include a case study discussion to apply concepts and tools from the readings and help develop students' thinking from a development finance perspective. Careful reading of case studies is required to determine key facts and circumstances of the case, to identify the critical issues raised by the case, and to be prepared to present your idea on these issues and how to address them.</p><h2 class=\"subhead\">Required Course Text</h2><p><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0761927093/ref=nosim/mitopencourse-20\"><img alt=\"Buy at Amazon\" align=\"absMiddle\" border=\"0\" src=\"/images/a_logo_17.gif\" /></a> Seidman, Karl F. <em>Economic Development Finance</em>.

The St. Claude Avenue Main Street District runs from Elysian Fields Avenue to Press Street. It is contained within the National/Local Historic District of Faubourg Marigny. The area consists of a mix of small storefront and residential buildings interspersed with a few large structures, a number of bar/music venues, and two art galleries. The streetscape's centerpiece is the St. Roch market, one of about two dozen such market buildings owned by the city as a part of a city-wide market access plan. Until the levee breaks and flooding of August 2005, the market was a point of access for locals to buy fresh food and sea foods. The market's fate is seen as mirroring the fate of the surrounding area. The building is currently targeted as one of the city's recovery areas and $600,000 has been earmarked for restoration.</p> <p>Additional background on the St. Claude area and the project. (<a href=\"/courses/urban-studies-and-planning/11-439-revitalizing-urban-main-streets-st-claude-avenue-new-orleans-spring-2009/syllabus/MIT11_439s09_syll01_Additional_Background_St_Claude.pdf\">PDF</a>)</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Class Project</h2> <p>Each neighborhood Main Street district will serve as a separate client for a team of six to ten students. Each district team may divide its planning work into smaller sub-teams of three to four students. Throughout the semester, these teams will present their work for discussion and commentary by the entire class with client input. The Main Street district's role as client will include:</p> <ul> <li>Facilitating student research by providing background material, serving as liaison to community members and organizations, and integrating student work into their planning process</li> <li>Providing guidance on the district's goals and priorities</li> <li>Assisting student efforts with district volunteers if necessary</li> <li>Providing feedback on the proposed agenda and draft plan elements</li> </ul> <p>The three stages of the class project are the following:</p> <h3 class=\"subsubhead\">Baseline Analysis to Document Existing Conditions and Identify Priority Areas for Detailed Planning</h3> <p>In this first phase, student teams will collect and analyze data to better understand existing physical and economic conditions in the business district, local visions and goals for the district among stakeholders, existing activities and plans, and key future opportunities. This work will include: (a) reviewing existing data, regulations and studies; (b) surveying and mapping existing environmental and physical conditions; (c) conducting an inventory of existing properties and businesses; and (d) conducting demographic and economic analysis to create profiles of the district's market and key business sectors.</p> <p>Based on the findings from this preliminary analysis, student teams will recommend an improvement agenda with priority opportunities and issues to address in their revitalization plans. After reviewing these findings and recommendations with the client and agreeing on the planning agenda, student teams will conduct more detailed research, analysis and design work to help formulate proposals around the selected agenda.</p> <h3 class=\"subsubhead\">Detailed Research, Analysis and Planning in Priority Areas</h3> <p>In this second phase, student teams will undertake more in-depth research, analysis and design in priority areas to better understand the requirements needed to realize goals and opportunities, assess existing resources and assets, identify critical obstacles and resources gaps to address, and define other factors that shape effective strategies and interventions to generate the Main Street district's desired revitalization goals.</p> <p>While specific research tasks will depend on the priority issues chosen, tasks may include conducting interviews with key stakeholders, surveying district customers and businesses, researching applicable zoning and regulatory obstacles, investigating design options, identifying best practices used in comparable neighborhoods/districts, and analyzing potential resources for implementation. Based on this detailed research, each student team will develop findings and recommendations for their final plan.</p> <h3 class=\"subsubhead\">Formulation of Recommendations and Preparation of the Final Plan</h3> <p>In the final phase, each student team will review the results of its analysis and research, develop initial proposals for key elements of the plan and integrate these recommendations into a draft overall business district revitalization plan. After a review of this draft plan with the entire class and the client, each team will revise its plan for a final public presentation and written report. Students will present the final plan to the client and an invited audience sometime during the final two weeks of class. The final report will be due one week after the last day of class.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Reflective Practice</h2> <p>Reflective practice is an ongoing goal of the class. Written exercises and class discussion will be used to help students understand how they think and learn in the course of action and deepen understanding of some of the core issues of planning practice. Students will be expected to keep an on-line journal where reflection assignments will be completed weekly. These assignments are geared to explore issues faced by planners during the planning process as well as document student professional growth and experiences working in multi-disciplinary teams. Many of the reflection exercises will focus on the following themes and questions:</p> <ul> <li>How are you combining your values, education and actions in complex situations in the professional work of the class?</li> <li>How are you learning from experiences? How are your experiences shaping your view of what it means to be good planner and what you need to be effective as a planner?</li> <li>What are the key issues, opportunities and challenges in planning for commercial districts and how are these similar to and different from other planning problems?</li> </ul> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Class Requirements</h2> <p>This class is a workshop and will meet twice weekly. The first session will be 1-1/2 hours in length and will be devoted to lectures and some discussion. The second session each week will be 2-1/2 hours and are reserved mostly for in-class work time and site visits. This schedule does not apply to the first two weeks of class, which will be mostly lecture with some discussion.</p> <p>Class requirements include extensive reading, ongoing assignments related to development of the plans, active class participation, field trips and site visits to the team project area and active involvement and contribution to the team project.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Grading</h2> <div class=\"maintabletemplate\"><table class=\"tablewidth50\" summary=\"See table caption for summary.\"> <caption class=\"invisible\">Grading criteria.</caption> <thead align=\"left\"> <tr> <th scope=\"col\">ACTIVITIES</th> <th scope=\"col\">PERCENTAGES</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody align=\"left\"> <tr class=\"row\"> <td>Active participation and contribution to class discussions</td> <td>15%</td> </tr> <tr class=\"alt-row\"> <td>Attendance</td> <td>10%</td> </tr> <tr class=\"row\"> <td>First short assignment</td> <td>10%</td> </tr> <tr class=\"alt-row\"> <td>Group project (develop an urban design/economic development plan)</td> <td>65%</td> </tr> </tbody> </table></div> <p> </p> <p>Team members will be asked to evaluate and grade each member of the group (including themselves) based on individuals' active participation in the project and contribution to the team.

Topics include the changing nature of community, social inequality, political power, socio-spatial change, technological change, and the relationship between the built environment and human behavior. We examine the key theoretical paradigms that have constituted the field since its founding, assess how and why they have changed over time, and discuss the implications of these paradigmatic shifts for urban scholarship, social policy and the planning practice. Our aim is two-fold: 1) to educate students about the nature and changing character of the city and the urban experience - including the larger social, political, and economic dynamics of urban change - so as to provide a more nuanced appreciation of the contemporary, comparative, and historical context in which urban planning skills and sensibilities have been developed and could be applied, and 2) to offer a &quot;sociology of knowledge&quot; approach to the field of urban sociology, so as to prepare more advanced students for pursuing an urban sociology concentration in preparation for doctoral exams.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Course Structure</h2> <p>The seminar will involve intensive discussions of assigned readings. Students will be encouraged to discuss how the theoretical and practical concerns that have preoccupied urban sociologists can be applied to their individual research interests (at both the MA and PhD level).</p> <p>Each week's readings are divided into three parts: required readings, additional core readings, and additional suggested readings. All students should read the required readings for each week. PhD students studying for their general exam in Urban Sociology should also read the additional core readings.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Grading</h2> <p>Final grades will be assigned based on the assignments and in-class activities listed below. Students are urged to pay close attention to due dates; late assignments will result in a significant grade penalty.

Hence, we have adopted a <strong>strict</strong> policy towards credit for assignments that is turned in late. We will consider requests for extensions due to extenuating circumstances on a case-by-case basis, but please do not count on such requests being granted.</p> <p>Lab exercises are typically due one week after the corresponding lab. A late lab exercise will be accepted up until one week after the original due date for a loss of one grade (e.g., a &quot;check&quot; becomes a &quot;check-minus&quot;). After that, late assignments will receive <strong>no</strong> credit and will <strong>not</strong> be accepted.</p> <p>Late problem sets will have two points deducted for each day (<strong>including</strong> weekends and holidays) after the due date that it is turned in. Hence, a problem set turned in three days late would lose 6 points. If it would have earned 90 points if turned in on time, it would receive only 84 points under these conditions. Regardless, no problem sets will be accepted after the answers have been posted, typically two weeks after the initial due date.</p> <p>Final project write-ups are due on the last day of classes. Write-ups turned in later will lose 5 points per day. No project write-ups will be accepted after one week past the last day of classes.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Texts</h2> <p><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1879102897/ref=nosim/mitopencourse-20\"><img alt=\"Buy at Amazon\" align=\"absMiddle\" border=\"0\" src=\"/images/a_logo_17.gif\" /></a> Ormsby, et al. <em>Getting to Know ArcGIS Desktop</em>.

The first half focuses on learning spatial database management techniques and methods and the second half focuses on using these skills to address a 'real world,' client-oriented planning problem. The first half of the semester may be taken separately using the class number 11.523 and the second half may be taken separately as 11.524.</p> <p>In order to help shape and utilize the information infrastructure that will support the management and development of our metropolitan areas, planners need a basic understanding of the tools and technology for querying, analyzing, and sharing complex databases and maps. Managing online access to large and constantly-changing spatial datasets can be a powerful aid to planning and can facilitate inter-agency cooperation and collaboration in an increasingly decentralized world. But it requires the use of knowledge representation methods, client-server technologies and access control issues that are quite different from what are needed to model and visualize standalone datasets on a personal computer. Hence, planners should acquire basic skills in database management, digital spatial data analysis, and networking.</p> <p>The <strong>11.523 portion of the semester</strong> addresses these issues while retaining a focus on planning (rather than on computer science). This is an intensive, hands-on class that stresses learning by doing. Exercises and examples involving real-world data, maps, and images are used to develop skills with database query languages and the design development and use of structured databases. Class work utilizes web tools, GIS, and database software with lab exercises. Specifically, we will access an Oracle 8i database using SQL (structured query language) and use ArcView for GIS. Each week there are two sixty to ninety-minute classes plus another 90+ minute hands-on lab in an electronic classroom. Class lectures will focus on concepts and case discussion, the scheduled lab time focuses on computer mechanics and skill building. Specific topics during 11.523 include:</p> <ul> <li>finding, understanding and structuring digital spatial data that are available on the Internet using various browsing, visualization, and data management tools;</li> <li>considerable work with relational database technologies and the Structured Query Language (SQL) to design, construct, query, and update urban planning databases;</li> <li>some experience with so-called 'client/server' and 'enterprise GIS' technologies for facilitating distributed access to complex spatial data and urban planning applications;</li> <li>advanced GIS topics such as 3D visualizations and geospatial web services.<br /> </li> </ul> <p>The <strong>11.524 portion of the semester</strong> will treat the classroom like a professional planning office, working as a team to produce a two deliverables for their client, Lawrence Community Works, Inc. (LCW), a community development corporation located in the City of Lawrence, Massachusetts. LCW and DUSP recently agreed to work together for the next five years to design and implement a multi-tier web-based planning system that promotes democratic involvement and informs community development projects. Your involvement this semester is critical, because the implementation plan that you craft this semester will serve as the road map for both organizations for years to come and the simple web-based planning tool that you design will engage stakeholders by giving them a better sense of how technologies can aid decision-making processes. Through their project work, students will enhance important professional skills by:</p> <ul> <li>formulating an implementation plan for a real client;</li> <li>designing a simple web-based tool for understanding problems;</li> <li>engaging constituents and stakeholders in a real setting;</li> <li>integrating theory and practice by evaluating the role of technology in community development;</li> <li>learning to communicate effectively within a group and with a professional consultant;</li> <li>working with such tools as the WWW, Access, ArcView, ArcIMS, SDE, etc.<br /> </li> </ul> <h2 class=\"subhead\">11.521 versus 11.523 or 11.524</h2> <ul> <li>The subject 11.521 = 11.523 + 11.524 and you can register for 11.521 or (11.523 plus 11.524) or either one of the half semester modules. </li> <li>The subject 11.521 is a full-semester class that earns 12 units ( 3-3-6) of H-level graduate credit</li> <li>The subject 11.523 includes classes 1-13 of 11.521 (plus labs) and earns 6 units (2-2-2) of H-level graduate credit. This subject covers the spatial database portion of 11.521</li> <li>The subject 11.524 includes classes 14-26 of 11.521 (plus labs) and earns units to be arranged (generally 1-1-4 unless you are taking 11.524 a second time). This subject covers the advanced GIS project portion of 11.521</li> <li>The subject 11.521 cannot be taken for credit with 11.523 or 11.524 in the same semester; the subject 11.524 can be taken again in another term. Students who have not decided in which class to enroll should sign up for both 11.521 and 11.523, then drop one of the subjects by the drop date.<br /> </li> </ul> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Prerequisites</h2> <p>The prerequisite for this class is</p> <p>(a) either</p> <ul> <li><strong>11.204</strong>: Planning, Communications and Digital Media, </li> <li> <strong>11.208</strong>: Introduction to Computers in Public Management II or</li> <li> <strong>11.520</strong>: A Workshop on Geographic Information Systems, and</li> </ul> <p>(b) an understanding of analytic methods that most undergraduates acquire via general Institute requirements and MCP students obtain from course from</p> <ul> <li><strong>11.220</strong>: Quantitative Reasoning and Statistical Analysis I (which may be taken concurrently).</li> </ul> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Requirements</h2> <p>Exercises, class discussions, and projects use real databases and problems taken from current Planning Support Systems (PSS), involving local and regional planning agencies. These data include parcel-level maps, tabular data, and digital orthophotos for all of Boston; land use, wetland, and other environmental planning datasets for the state; and detailed information about the neighborhoods being studied for the project.</p> <p>The full course includes nine lab exercises; 11.523 students complete the first six labs, and 11.524 students do the last three. Each lab includes an assignment to be turned in. To facilitate a quick turnaround on grading, these assignments will be evaluated on a three-point scale: check-minus, check, check-plus. Students in 11.521 and 11.523 will complete three homework sets and have an examination before Spring Break. Students in 11.521 and 11.524 will complete a half-semester group project during the second half of the term that provides an opportunity to apply GIS and database concepts in a more realistic context. The project concludes with an oral presentation to the client and a written report. In addition to preparing paper maps of various sizes, each team will build a web site to showcase its work.<br /> </p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Grading</h2> <p><strong>11.521:<br /> <br /> </strong>Grade is average of 11.523 and 11.524 grades</p> <p><strong>11.523:</strong></p> <ul> <li>6 Lab Exercises (collectively).............15%</li> <li>3 Problem Sets (collectively)..............45%</li> <li>Examination.......................................35%</li> <li>Class Participation...............................5%<br /> </li> </ul> <p><strong>11.524:</strong></p> <ul> <li>Lab 7.....................................................................................10%</li> <li>Lab 8.....................................................................................15%</li> <li>Lab 9.....................................................................................15%</li> <li>Internal and On-Site Project Presentations...........................10%</li> <li>Final Project Part one: Implementation..................................25%</li> <li>Final Project Part Two: Web-based Planning Application.......25%</li> </ul> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Lateness Policy</h2> <p>Turning in assignments promptly is important both for keeping current with the subject matter, which is cumulative, and to keep all students on a level playing field. Hence, we have adopted a strict policy towards credit for assignment that is turned in late.</p> <p>Lab exercises are typically due one week after the lab is run. A late lab exercise will be accepted up until one week after the original due date for a loss of one grade (e.g., a &quot;check&quot; becomes a &quot;check-minus&quot;). After that, late assignments will receive no credit and will not be accepted. </p> <p>Late problem sets will have two points deducted for each day (including weekends and holidays) after the due date. Hence, a problem set turned in three days late would lose 6 points. If it would have earned 90 points if turned in on time, it would receive only 84 points under these conditions. Regardless, no problem sets will be accepted after the answers have been posted, typically two weeks after the initial due date.<br /> </p> <div class=\"help slide-bottom\"> <div class=\"help-message\"> <a class=\"help-engage\" href=\"javascript: trackEvents('Bottom Get Started','bottom get started Click','Help Overlay');\">Need help getting started?</a> <a href=\"javascript:disableHelpPopup(); trackEvents('Bottom Don\\'t Show','bottom don\\'t show Click','Help Overlay');\" class=\"help-dismiss\">Don't show me this again</a> </div> </div> <div class=\"help popup-center\"> <div class=\"help-message\"> <p class=\"help-dismiss\"><a href=\"javascript:disableHelpPopup(); trackEvents('Popup Don\\'t Show','popup don\\'t show Click','Help Overlay');\">Don't show me this again</a></p> <h2>Welcome!</h2> <p>This is one of over 2,200 courses on OCW.

The seminar is closely tied to current Urban Information Systems (UIS) research in the MIT Urban Studies and Planning Department. Much of this research involves geographic information systems (GIS), multimedia technologies and the design and prototyping of urban planning tools and metropolitan information infrastructure. Ongoing work also involves institutional analysis and new theories about planning strategies, the economics of place, and land use and transportation interactions. 11.522 is intended to enable advanced Master's and PhD students to work on special projects of interest to them which can be related to ongoing UIS work in order to tap into a critical mass of information, technology, planning context, and peer review.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Course Description and Content</h2> <p>Seminar participants and invited guests will lead critical discussions of current literature and ongoing research. Each student will be responsible for identifying, reviewing, and presenting one structured discussion of articles from the current literature that are relevant to their research topic. The remaining time will be spent working on individual projects or thesis proposals. This fall, the seminar will focus on the following core issues that underlie most implementations of urban information systems and decision support tools:</p> <ul> <li> <p>The sustainable acquisition and representation of urban knowledge</p> </li> <li> <p>The emergent technological infrastructure for supporting metropolitan decision-making</p> </li> <li> <p>The innovative organizational and institutional arrangements that can take advantage of modern urban information systems</p> </li> </ul> <p>During the semester, there will be occasional UIS seminar talks by outside speakers. These talks will provide insight and in-depth discussion about the knowledge representation, technology, and institutional dimensions of some of the topics covered in the weekly DUSP program group seminars. Generally, these seminars will take place over Friday lunch, and we'll try to hold them during the same week as the corresponding program group talk. These in-depth UIS seminars will be considered part of 11.522, and students taking 11.522 will be expected to attend these occasional Friday lunch seminars.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Format</h2> <p>Each week, there will be one session lasting up to two hours (during the scheduled Tuesday afternoon time) for discussion of research areas, class projects, and selected articles. Additional lab hours will be arranged as needed to facilitate access to equipment and data that students may need for their projects. Each student will be responsible for (a) leading at least one class discussion of published papers in the current literature concerning a selected topic of interest, (b) undertaking an individual or group project involving a written and oral presentation, and (c) participating in seminar discussions and out-of-class email exchanges. A schedule of topics and presenters is given in the <a href=\"/courses/urban-studies-and-planning/11-522-research-seminar-on-urban-information-systems-fall-2005/calendar\">calendar</a> section. Individual class projects typically lead to a thesis proposal, empirical study, comparative analysis, computer-based modeling exercise, and/or the demonstration of a software prototype.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Prerequisites and Sequencing</h2> <p>While most projects are likely to involve hands-on use of GIS and database management technologies, this is not a requirement. However, students <strong>are</strong> expected to have some knowledge of metropolitan information infrastructures and digital representations of 'place' and spatial relationships prior to taking 11.522 (see the list of prerequisites below). Typically, this involves GIS and database management skills. Students should have sufficient computing proficiency and an understanding of information and communication technology use in urban planning - as evidenced by <a href=\"/courses/urban-studies-and-planning/11-204-planning-communications-and-digital-media-fall-2004/index.htm\">11.204</a> (Planning, Communication, and Digital Media) and at least one of <a href=\"/courses/urban-studies-and-planning/11-520-a-workshop-on-geographic-information-systems-fall-2005/index.htm\">11.520</a> (A Workshop on Geographic Information Systems), <strong>or</strong> <a href=\"/courses/urban-studies-and-planning/11-521-spatial-database-management-and-advanced-geographic-information-systems-spring-2003/index.htm\">11.521</a> (Spatial Database Management), or equivalent. MCP students normally take this course during their second year with the intention of linking the course to thesis preparation, an internship, and the like. PhD students often take the subject more than once as they work on their first-year paper, general exam preparation, research assistantships, and dissertation.</p> <div class=\"help slide-bottom\"> <div class=\"help-message\"> <a class=\"help-engage\" href=\"javascript: trackEvents('Bottom Get Started','bottom get started Click','Help Overlay');\">Need help getting started?</a> <a href=\"javascript:disableHelpPopup(); trackEvents('Bottom Don\\'t Show','bottom don\\'t show Click','Help Overlay');\" class=\"help-dismiss\">Don't show me this again</a> </div> </div> <div class=\"help popup-center\"> <div class=\"help-message\"> <p class=\"help-dismiss\"><a href=\"javascript:disableHelpPopup(); trackEvents('Popup Don\\'t Show','popup don\\'t show Click','Help Overlay');\">Don't show me this again</a></p> <h2>Welcome!</h2> <p>This is one of over 2,200 courses on OCW.

It is also open to all DUSP/TPP students interested in &quot;the environmental policy debate&quot; as well as the range of environmental planning tools and techniques that are the focus of the course.</p> <p>There are no prerequisites. The class is taught comparatively, that is, with constant reference to examples from around the world.</p> <p>The course consists of three parts: <strong>The Environmental Policy Debate</strong>, <strong>Environmental Planning Techniques and Strategies</strong>, and <strong>Synthesis and Preparation for Practice</strong>. The first part of the course revolves around debate-style presentations in which student teams test contrary arguments drawing on the relevant philosophical literature. The second part of the course provides an overview of techniques and strategies for environmental management and planning. The third part of the course introduces students to Environmental Policy Group (EPG) faculty work and helps students formulate a plan for the remainder of their MCP studies.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Course Requirements</h2> <p>Students are encouraged to attend class meetings.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Required Text</h2> <h3 class=\"subsubhead\">Part III: Environmental Planning Techniques and Strategies</h3> <p></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1559639482/ref=nosim/mitopencourse-20\"><img alt=\"Buy at Amazon\" src=\"/images/a_logo_17.gif\" align=\"absmiddle\" border=\"0\" /></a> Randolph, John. <em>Environmental Land Use Planning and Management</em>.

Two games will be played in class and two will be played outside of class. These games present a series of situations in which you will have an opportunity to apply the ideas and techniques discussed in class in the face of numerous institutional obstacles. One simulation deals with the management of sustainability, one with environmental impact assessment, one with joint fact finding and one with environmental justice considerations in facility siting.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Participation in Debates</h2> <p>Everyone will be asked to choose one of these four debates in which to participate. These are <strong>not</strong> Oxford-style debates. We are interested in understanding more about the philosophical underpinning of various &quot;ethical claims,&quot; not in choosing a winner and a loser. Your grade will be solely a function of how well you prepared and presented your ideas, not on the point-of-view you adopted.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Recitations</h2> <p>Recitations are not required, but you might find useful the few that are scheduled.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Grading</h2> <p>Grading will be based on in-person (class discussion, out-of-class simulations) and on-line (journal writing, commentary) participation and completion of the final memo. In the final memo you will be asked to highlight how you intend to use the remaining three semesters at MIT to prepare to be an effective environmental planner.

It is required of all first-year doctoral students in the Department of Urban Studies and Planning (and supports completion of their first-year research papers), but it is open to other students, including cross-registrants from other universities. A small number of listeners (auditors) will be permitted.</p> <p>The course explores ways to make research knowledge more accessible, credible, and useful in the realm of public policy and practice, a project in which the course faculty collectively bring decades of professional experience, in both academic and non-academic roles.</p> <p>The course addresses the politics of the policymaking process, the power of framing and agenda-setting, fads and paradigms in the design professions and society in general, how knowledge diffuses along knowledge and influence networks, and how varied types of knowledge (rational, craft, other) and deliberation shape decision-making and action. The course engages a number of guests to present case studies of research in use (and abuse) in varied fields, highlighting rich areas for potential research contributions, along with major conflicts in public values, political interests, ethical obligations, and more. The resulting dilemmas confront scholars, policymakers, practitioners, and others as they look to research â sometimes â for useful guidance, influence, or both.</p> <h3 class=\"subsubhead\">Prerequisites</h3> <p>None. Cross-registrants are welcome, as are <strong>listeners</strong> (as defined by MIT) who do the reading and participate in discussions but do not complete written assignments or receive a letter grade.</p> <p>The <strong>primary objectives</strong> of the course are:</p> <ul> <li>To develop skills for analyzing and shaping the <strong>influence</strong> of ideas â not just the ideas themselves â in varied contexts and situations (policy advocacy, implementation advice, practice norms, etc.);</li> <li>To enhance writing and research formulation skills with academic and non-academic audiences in mind;</li> <li>To explore the value of &quot;scientific&quot; vs. other forms of knowledge; </li> <li>To reflect on the ethical obligations of researchers in their multiple roles as inquirers, advocates, educators, policy experts, and more, as media markets, political partisanship, and other forces demand more and more &quot;point-of-view research&quot;; and</li> <li>To help students examine their career choices and assumptions in light of the knowledge influence and impact themes.</li> </ul> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Structure</h2> <p>While the schedule is defined somewhat by the availability of particular guests, the course proceeds in three phases:</p> <ol> <li><strong>Foundations</strong>, covering major conceptual frameworks for analysis: general models of knowledge production and use, including rationality and its critics; the politics of the policymaking process; and frames and persuasion. These foundations are concerned with broad patterns of influence on thinking in society, as well as influence on authoritative decisions by public policymakers. The capstone exercise for this first phase is a midterm exam.</li> <li><strong>Knowledge-in-use (or abuse) cases</strong>, drawing on the frameworks above or other frameworks as applied to a variety of public issues.</li> <li><strong>Application</strong>, with a focus on the term assignment, in which students analyze a case of knowledge-in-use, according to their interests, and write a research brief on a topic they care about. </li> </ol> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Format and Requirements</h2> <p>This is a reading and discussion-intensive course, with the heaviest reading concentrated in the pre-exam phase. Students should be prepared to participate actively in each session and occasionally to lead discussion.</p> <p><strong>Assignments</strong> include a take-home midterm exam, a research brief, and a final paper analyzing some case of knowledge in use (student's choice). For MIT doctoral students, that paper and the brief should be linked topically to the first-year paper, which the course assignments are designed to complement. For other students, the course assignments may complement qualifying papers or similarly substantial research papers. The exam helps connect the problem of research design and formulation of questions with course frameworks; the brief is an exercise in presenting your research effectively to non-specialists; and the case paper analyzes the &quot;public face&quot; â the controversies, utilization of knowledge, public opinion and/or decisionmaking contexts â of a topic you are writing up in the first-year paper or some other research paper.</p> <p>Students will submit a brief, nongraded problem statement, early in the semester, to begin framing and defining the case paper focus. The exam punctuates the first half of the course, and the case paper and brief become our focus for the latter half.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Grading</h2> <div class=\"maintabletemplate\"> <table class=\"tablewidth50\" summary=\"See table caption for summary.\"> <caption class=\"invisible\">Grading criteria.</caption> <thead align=\"left\"> <tr> <th scope=\"col\">ACTIVITIES</th> <th scope=\"col\">PERCENTAGES</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody align=\"left\"> <tr class=\"row\"> <td>Class participation</td> <td>10%</td> </tr> <tr class=\"alt-row\"> <td>Midterm</td> <td>35%</td> </tr> <tr class=\"row\"> <td>Case paper</td> <td>35%</td> </tr> <tr class=\"alt-row\"> <td>Research brief</td> <td>20%</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> </div> <br /> <p>Those enrolling at listener status will receive credit upon completion of the course, assuming regular attendance and preparation.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Democracy (and Responsibility) in the Classroom</h2> <p>A premise of the course is that our own efforts to engage challenging topics will reflect the very real-world challenges we wish to understand. The classroom is thus a case in point, and while faculty bear a special responsibility given their role in guiding the work, every class member is responsible for contributing to our success. Some working principles:</p> <ul> <li>Respect with challenge: Promoting mutual respect, being as inclusive as possible, but being willing to disagree thoughtfully where it will support a better discussion or bring important ideas and differences in perspective (vantage point) into view;</li> <li>Curiosity with candor: Following questions, questioning &quot;givens&quot; (prevailing assumptions, for example);</li> <li>Listening actively: Listening to understand, checking assumptions, not simply waiting our turns to talk; and</li> <li>Assuming responsibility: In our case, for the work of making the classroom an effective place for learning together, being more than a spectator.</li> </ul> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Course Materials</h2> <p>Beginning with class session two, you will read assigned material guided by specific study questions, though you are welcome to go beyond them. The questions are linked to our central objectives for the case (or other discussion topic), which is linked in turn to the larger course objectives. In some instances, we will offer recommended readings or lists as take-away resources on important topics.</p> <div class=\"help slide-bottom\"> <div class=\"help-message\"> <a class=\"help-engage\" href=\"javascript: trackEvents('Bottom Get Started','bottom get started Click','Help Overlay');\">Need help getting started?</a> <a href=\"javascript:disableHelpPopup(); trackEvents('Bottom Don\\'t Show','bottom don\\'t show Click','Help Overlay');\" class=\"help-dismiss\">Don't show me this again</a> </div> </div> <div class=\"help popup-center\"> <div class=\"help-message\"> <p class=\"help-dismiss\"><a href=\"javascript:disableHelpPopup(); trackEvents('Popup Don\\'t Show','popup don\\'t show Click','Help Overlay');\">Don't show me this again</a></p> <h2>Welcome!</h2> <p>This is one of over 2,200 courses on OCW.

Policymakers and practitioners rarely explore solutions by examining the fundamental problem: the failure of interested parties to act collectively to internalize the positive externalities generated by public goods. Public finance is merely one of many possible institutional arrangements for assigning the rights and responsibilities to public goods consumption. This system is currently under stress because of the financial crisis. The first part of the class will focus on collective action and its connection with local public finance. The second part will explore alternative institutional arrangements for mediating collective action problems associated with the provision of local public goods.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Course Objective</h2> <p>The objective of the seminar is to broaden the discussion of local public finance by incorporating collective action problems into the discourse. This inclusion aims at exploring alternative institutional arrangements for financing local public services in the face of severe economic downturn. Applications of emerging ideas to the provision of public health, education, and natural resource conservation will be discussed.</p> <h2 class=\"subhead\">Course Requirements</h2> <p>1. <strong>Leading class discussion</strong><br /> Each student will be responsible for leading at least two class discussions.
